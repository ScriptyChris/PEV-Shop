I have dropped this and it has skid across horribly rough asphalt dozens of times, and both the cover and wheel look new. Well... except the pedals and handle! Great investment, helps reduce impact to plastic and keep scratches down. It also holds my pads in place after having to remove/reinstall them for servicing. Softer on the inner legs too. Waiting on bigger pedals and then my 18L truly will feel like a plush luxury vehicle.",

          "content": "Bought this cover in black and it's awesome. Definitely does a great job protecting the wheel. Fitment is a little awkward but honestly it's pretty straight forward. One thing to note is I had an issue where the cover was bulging (kinda like the fit wasn't snug) at the front and near the bottom where the cover attaches. I thought forever the it was loose and just a one off defect and it may be but I'm thinking at this point that it's normal. Basically you have to pull at the light and sensor/power button cutouts to make it snug. NOT pull the bottom down to make it snug because that will just cause the same problem on the other side of  the wheel. I imagine the covers are hand made so entirely possible mine doesn't fit exactly right. Side note and a nice touch was that they put nice soft leather on the little pockets that attach to the inside of the wheel casing/side panels to keep the case on. I think the wheel looks a lot better with the cover on since it smooths over the sharp edges the 18XL naturally has. Has perfectly protected my wheel completely from some gnarly falls/drops. Don't forget to take it off every couple weeks or even sooner to clean the dust that builds up on the underside of the cover and in the leather pockets that attach to the lower casing/side panels. Overall thumbs up, definitely worth it!! Wish they had this for the MSX and other wheels!",

I liked the original white/grey model but the stealth model is definitely nice.    I'm glad I was able to be part of the batch that was the last of the 512wh variants but understand the reasons for standardizing.    \n\nJason, Drew, and the rest of the folks over at eWheels are top notch and being here in Hawaii, one of the only retailers shipping to the 50th state!    I placed my order back in July when these things were on back-order, but they've been fantastic in providing fast communication to any of my questions and concerns throughout.    This is my first wheel, with my sights set on a larger wheel in the near future(V11/RS/Sherman).    Admittedly, the first time I laid eyes on the MTen3 in a Youtube video(thanks Marty), I knew instantly that was the wheel for me; It has the perfect blend of size, power, and speed for my needs.    I know some riders of larger wheels might pooh pooh this little guy, but because I have plans to purchase a larger wheel in the future, I wanted something that was going to be very different and something that I would keep, as opposed to having multiple wheels that had too many similarities in size, specs, and ride characteristics.    The MTen3 covers all those bases and also looks great all in black!",

So I bought the MTen3 for last mile pedestrian distances when I want to take the train into the city or the beach. I'm in the Los Angeles area. This is my first EUC and I neither skateboard nor have experience in any like activity. I'm a total newbie to this. \n\nThe first minutes were shaky but after an hour I was able to glide 15'-20', though using a chain link fence as a safety rail. It does feel wobbly still but I figure more practice will acclimate me, so I'm heading out again this morning for another hour of practice. I am completely satisfied that I will be able to master this. What a fun and practical investment this was.",

This is my second wheel, the KingSong 14d was my first wheel. The Mten3 wide tire makes ride more stable than the narrow 14d tire, so I like it on walking paths and other areas where crowds are, because you can balance even at low speeds. I've taken it up mild inclines and it handles my size with no problems at all!! One of the reasons I purchased this was to take on flights, because my medical condition makes it extremely hard to walk long distance, so this can literally fit in my backpack and I can visit new areas and site see without stressing about over exerting myself. Only thing I hate is the look of the lights, not my style at all!! I painted mine flat black and painted over the lights, YeapR sure did. Haha. \nI've been upgrading to bigger faster wheels fairly fast so I haven't really put this wheel to the test, so I cant comment on range, speed and durability. The fastest I've have it was 18mph on smooth interior floor, it does get a lil squirrely at higher speeds on surfaces with imperfections, so I'm nervous going high speeds on this outside but it can be done, you can watch YouTube videos of people riding really fast with skill. \nIt's awesome that we can have a wheel that fits into a backpack and that goes 25mph and carry someone my size with ease, awesome!\nMy thoughts about ewheels:\nI've purchased 4 wheels from ewheels, so far and they have proven to be true professionals when it comes to providing the best product to the public and they are true professionals when it comes to providing the best customer service!!\nI'm shocked at how quickly they have answered all of questions. Believe you me, I have bugged them a lot with questions! Haha \nI'll be buying my next wheel from ewheels, I just have to decide which one to buy!",

MTen3 512Wh/800W Motor.\n\n\"Tiny but might\" is what I'd refer it to, speedy and not needy due to the power of this little wheel and  basically no maintenance! \n\nPros:\nCompact, nice torque, fast, nimble, durable, FUN!\n\nI've never own or knew about electric unicycle until a few weeks ago, after doing lots of research and with the help of eWheels team I've concluded that the MTen3 would be my best first wheel.\nZero regrets on getting this wheel, not having any prior experiences of riding an EUC it only took me 15 minutes to get going. My tip to you is to just get on and ride, it'll be hard, it'll tire you out, it'll bite you in the ankle a few times and again, but it's totally worth it. You can't buy happiness? WRONG, buy this wheel and you'll not only have happiness, but you'll create wonderful memories with it. Sometimes a little painful but it's part of the sport.\n\nCons:\nSpeed is fast! but is it bad to ask for faster? In this case yes, if you go too fast and you're not use to this wheel, you'll encounter \"speed wobble\" ideal speed for me is 18-22 mph.\nYou'll feel a lot of the road that you're riding on, smooth roads are no problem, however if you ride over bumps and cracks... you'll fell it. Best to ride with your knees bent.\nBattery life... this is something I'm over expecting, I'm happy with my current riding distance (it hurts to ride long distance due to my conditioning) but when I'm more conditioned to ride further I'd would love for it to go at least 30 miles distance. Currently I'm getting 14-18 miles based on how I ride and my weight (190lbs on a good day without gears on) with average speed of 12 miles per  hour.\nOther than those little picky things, I'm so happy with it.\n\nIn all, grab it and never let it go. Trust me, you'll want to own 2-3 wheels on average once you get into this sport. \n\nAmazing beginner wheel.\n\n*** Wheel PSI is recommended by me around 35 PSI if you're 190lbs, however you'll get more speed wobble if you're not use to it. Just drop PSI to 25-30 for more control, down side to this is you'll get less miles in range due to the motor having to work harder but it'll feel more smooth.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nPlease wear a helmet....",

This thing is super easy to learn, especially if your into any other type of activity that requires balance while moving. Once you’ve got the hang of it you’ll notice how agile and nimble this wheel can be. Iv been practicing in parking lots, and weaving around marked lines has been so engaging that before i knew it 17+ miles had been traveled just swerving around. The compact size of this thing makes it easier to carry around and the fact that it’s less aggressive looking than other wheels attracts less unwanted attention. It would be nice if it came with a handle, but Here’s the thing that I don’t like about this wheel...even though it’s small or maybe because it is.....it wobbles like a bucking bronco at 14+ mph.....This could be due to my inexperience but I doubt that’s the only reason why. So far my impression is that this is a really fun, smooth and agile wheel best suited for agility and cruising at slow to moderate speeds. Unless you have the reflexes of a cat or have been practicing your rodeo skills be sure to wear safety gear because it’s unavoidable that at some point your going to need it.",

          "content": "I love my Mten3! This is my first electric unicycle - I got hooked on personal electric vehicles when I bought Speedway Mini 4 Pro e-scooter from eWheels about 1.5 years ago. Despite Mini4 being quite compact and lightweight, it can be quite cumbersome when using in public transportation, carrying up stairs, etc. So I needed something more compact and lightweight... a \"pocket rocket\". Mten3 just is such a pocket rocket! It's perfect for getting around the city and even for some mild offroad fun, too!\n\nIt's so small that it fits in a small $10 backpack sized for middle-school kids. And despite only 325Wh capacity (I bought the 84V/325Wh version), I can still go 20 miles on it - same range as with Mini4, which has almost double the capacity! (614Wh) It's amazingly efficient. (I'm very heavy - right at the max allowable weight - and it's just stunning to me that a little thing I can carry in a small backpack, can go such a distance, with almost half the weight (10kg Mten3 vs. 16kg Mini4), half the battery, and perhaps third the size.)\n\nIt took me a couple of days to learn to ride, but it's not bad. I think the steep-ish angle of the pedals helps to \"lock in\" the wheel between your legs, which increases stability. The agility of this pocket rocket is amazing. It very easy to ride even on crowded sidewalks like in tourist places - when you see a clearing between people, you accelerate rapidly and \"jump\" into the next \"slot\". The precision of riding Mten3 is just fantastic - you can efficiently \"percolate\" any crowd.\n\nThe included wrist protectors are a nice touch - they're decent, very compact, and quite comfortable. I took a couple of falls with them - they saved my hands like a champ. The larger black pedals and the lift-off switch are very nice, too.\n\nOverall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase. Amazingly fast delivery, too - placed the order, next day I have a new toy in my hands! Highly recommend it. You won't regret getting Mten3 from eWheels!",

Experimented with soft, medium and hard ride settings and for now am using soft. Hard to find what each setting means?  Bonus feature discovered. New button by handle which disengages motor when lifted. Work in progress for me cause of differences compared to my 14” wheel which I can use pretty handily now. Think over time MTen3 will be great for riding around neighborhood. Not really a commuter wheel. Recommend that eWheels translate or make a short instruction manual for this model and any other Gotway products if they continue to sell the line. Just my 2 cents",

When I start riding it coming from KS18S which is my first wheel, there is some sort of riding adjustment but not too difficult. It is very nimble and good in tight spaces particulary leisurely cruising in slow speed in a crowded street. However, doesn't recommend it for long ride especially speed above 10 mph, the wheel can wobble if you don't pay attention. In addition, you need more breaks during rides because your feet can easily get numb from standing. Unlike my KS18S, it is comfortable for cruising and long rides without much fatigue on my feet because it has a seat I can use allowing my legs and feet to rest while riding. Always wear full face helmet and other protective gears...don't underestimate this little bad boy, it has a lot of torque! Safety first while having fun! Between my KS18S and this wheel, I will be riding more the mten3 because of being compact, powerful and easy to bring to any places! Get one yours now, you will not regret. -- Lorenzo",

I have an electric skateboard (backfire g2t) and an electric scooter (inokim ox super). I like the MTen3 way better than the previous two. \nThe electric skateboard is super-fast (good), it stops super-fast (bad). The bad is due to the skateboard slows down before you do and the only thing that’s keeping you on the board is the grip tape. Second, the solid wheel vibration wears out and numbs my feet. It does not turn, and road cracks & bumps will cause big hurt if not careful. Unless the road condition is perfectly smooth, it sucks.\nThe electric scooter doesn’t have any of the issues of the electric skateboard and better in every way (because it has 10-inch tires, disc brakes, 800w – 1200w motor, 20Ah battery, and suspensions). However, it is 28kg and BIG (worse than a golf bag)!\nPro:\n1.\tLight 22-25 lbs. (I think it is the lightness of all EUC wheels).\n2.\tCompact!!!\n3.\tGood acceleration and breaking.\n4.\tRange 20 miles easy (70kg person).\nCon:\n1.\tNot for beginners (I learned that hard way, first time with a EUC).\n2.\tWheel size the causes of lots of wobbles (Either from the rider or the road condition).\n3.\tLower speed limit “below 20mph” (It’s a safety issue, size of the wheel, high speed, equals to more and stronger wobbles).\n4.\tSmall peddle means the feet get tired and numb easier.\n5.\tTires (wish the tires have more grip and knobbier).\nTips for beginners:\n1.\tFind your center of gravity on the wheel (you will know once you find it).\n2.\tTrain on smooth pavement.\n3.\tPractice stopping.\n4.\tMount and Ride with your chest out.\n5.\tLook and turn your shoulder toward the direction you want to go.\n6.\tRelax your feet and legs (Stiff legs and feet causes wobbles).\n7.\tAt least 10 plus hours before you can ride the MTen3 confidently and comfortably.\n8.\tBe very vigilant looking at the road condition ahead of you (it’s not the potholes that will cause you problems, it’s the side bumps that will make you fall).\nWishlist: MTen3, everything the same in an 18inch wheel.",

          "content": "Owned the Mten3 for 11 months.  Weigh 200lbs.  Use it for last mile transport.  The torque makes this an extremely safe wheel.   Torque is the ability to speed up and slow down quickly.  Max range on flat terrain at about 15MPH is around 14 miles in the summer and about 9 miles when temps are in the high 30's to low 40's.  I maxed out the speed at 41km/hr one time.  The right cruising speed on this one for me is 22-25km/hr.  This is my first wheel and I had a bunch of falls.  The wheel took a bad beating from my learning process and it keeps going.  Charges in about 3 hours or so and that will get someone about a 1.25 hours of reasonable pace riding in the Summer.  Two maintenance issues that came up.  After 3 months, the tire deflated.  I didn't know how to put slime in it and shipped it back to Ewheels who got it fixed and also upgraded the foot petals for a modest sum.  Recently, the charger that came with it blew out recently and Ewheels replaced it - no charge.   This is the Company to do business with.  They can fix these wheels and have them back in less then a week.  Total turn time on repairs from my door to them and back again is less than 2 weeks.  Can't beat that service.",

          "content": "The MTen3 is my first wheel and it has exceeded all expectations.  I’ve had it a week and rode 70km. By now, I am comfortable riding it and I feel as if it responds to my thoughts.  I wish I had purchased this years ago.  The wheel accelerates quickly and feels satisfyingly torquey.   I’ve never fallen (except the very first time I tried to stand on it), but it has come out from under me a few times due to my errors.   The bottoms of the pedals are scraped up and there are a few scrapes around the edges. The scratches don’t show on the white parts but they do show a bit on the black parts.\n\nI can go slowly and I can go fast, but I don’t feel comfortable faster than 18mph as the vehicle starts to wobble, however, it is entirely possible that the wobbling originates from me.  My feet get tired after about 20 minutes, but every day I have more endurance and can go further.  The sides of my calves hurt for the first few days.\n\nThe MTen3 does not struggle when I put my two children in a double-stroller and push them to and from daycare which is a bit less than a mile through the city.  I mostly use this vehicle for downtown commuting in a major US city.  It fits in my gym locker! I don’t go down (or up) curbs with it, but there are no shortages of bumps, dips, and cracks. I’ve had it out in light rain before with no problems. I’ve also taken it on a few longer bike-path trips which are very enjoyable.  It is easy to pick up and carry like a briefcase and only one person in a hundred will notice that I’m carrying something uncommon; people probably assume it is a cooler or a trendy bag and don't look twice.  It fits in a standard paper grocery bag (if I want to be very inconspicuous).\n\nThe Cons: \n1.\tNo Manual\n2.\tDownloading and Side-loading the app took a few attempts.\n3.\tThe seam in the plastic opposite the underside of the handle is rough enough to cut your knuckles, especially when you try to carry it while wearing wrist guards.    You can mitigate this by putting a piece of clear (scotch) tape along the seam.  I wear thin, fingerless- UV gloves under my wrist guards which protects me from the seam.  \n4.\tIt does not turn off when you lift it up.\n5.\tThe on/off beep is very loud and you have to hold the button for a few seconds. \n6.\tThe handle should be rounded for ease on the hand; as you will be carrying it a lot. \n7.\tI wish it included a cover. \n\nCaveat: \nThis vehicle can be carried around easily and inconspicuously, but before you purchase, make sure that you can comfortably carry 25lb pounds in one hand.   \n\nIn conclusion, I am fully satisfied and delighted with the MTen3.  It is great for last-mile commutes, errands, and joy-riding.  It is very practical for anyone who can easily carry 25lbs in one hand.",

          "content": "Solowheel glide 3-  It took me 4 one hour sessions over the course of four days to learn to ride.  It took my daughter 2 one hour sessions to learn how to ride.  The past 200 miles of use has been fantastic!  I have taken the solowheel on paved roads, sidewalks, paved trails, climbed up fairly steep hills, and I have done some slight off roading.  I have ridden it though mud and puddles of water that were just below the pedals.  The pedals are up high which makes it nice to just glide though the various environments that are thrown your way.  \n\nTiltback on the pedals begins coming in at 15mph and you can push the glide to 18mph, but any extended time and your feet will get tired relatively quickly due to the the nature of the incline of the pedals during tiltback.  Its sleek design looks futuristic and the LEDs just make for a cool looking night ride. \n\nDuring the learning process I crashed the solowheel multiple times and it just kept on ticking.  I've put the glide 3 through the ringer on numerous occasions and even though it has several scuff marks and scratches it still turns on and functions like it did when I pulled it out of the box.  \n\nRange-  I'm 5'7\" and 200ish lbs give or take a few and I can get about 17 miles before it's reading below 10%.\n\nAcceleration and handling- This thing is light, nimble, easy to turn, and easy to learn on.  Quick bursts of speed are fantastic from a dead stop or even at speed.\n\nModifications/Alterations-  *Disclosure* I come from the automotive world where we can take vehicles, mod them to be faster and look more visually appealing to us.  I find this department a little lacking, but I believe that is with most EUCs.  While the customization for the LED's is neat there is not whole lot more you can do with this wheel.  I did upgrade the pedals to a much larger size.  This was totally worth the upgrade as the expansion of foot space made it ride easier, ride more comfortably, and aided in maneuverability.  The XL pedals really should have come on this wheel from the factory.  If you are seriously considering this wheel, make this your first purchase after the safety gear.  (Reason for 4 stars and not 5) \n\nCons (Reason for 4 stars and not 5) - I would say the headlight could use some work.  While it's sufficient in low lighting areas in urban neighborhoods;  night riding is less than steller through dark places.  I would highly recommend a flashlight of some sort if that's when you plan to ride.  The inmotion app that you use for the solowheel constantly disconnects from the wheel.  However, when it stays connected it's for the most part user friendly and some small adjustments can be made.  \n\nWith all that being said this is a great starter wheel that you can grow into, however I find the cruising speed just not fast enough for me and I will be upgrading to a more robust  wheel.",

I had considered selling the Glide 3, but have decided to keep it.  The ease of transporting the small and light Glide 3 will make it more practical than the 16x in some situations.   It easily fits in the trunk of my Miata and I can ride it anywhere I used to ride my bicycle.    For the price, the Glide 3 is an amazing machine with size and weight as an advantage over higher level wheels if you need to carry or transport it, or if you need to store it in a locker.",

          "content": "Bought this from ewheels about 2 months ago as my first wheel.  It’s definitely a great wheel and has taken several top speed crashes without any major damage, I can verify it’s durability.  However, after putting 150 miles on it, I feel I’ve already outgrown it.  Wish I had just spent a little more and bought a faster wheel from the start that I could have grown into.  IMHO, nobody just starting out has the ability to ride as fast as it will go.  That comes with time.  But, my next machine will need to go just a little bit faster so that it doesn’t seem slow when max speed is achieved.  Once I achieved it, as comfortable as it is, I am wanting a little bit more.  The only reason I say this is that at half battery, it will beep at you incessantly trying to tilt back and reduce your speed to what feels like a crawl.  As a safety issue, it works great, but as you gain experience on the wheel and near the 100 mile mark of riding, I am needing just as you will probably also will be wanting, a wheel with more speed and range because of how fun these great little machines are to ride.  100 miles really isn’t that far when you start having as much fun on yours as I have had on mine.  It’s only a little annoying at first when the battery reaches the half way point, but, after a little time and riding experience it does become really very annoying.  You want to go faster but can’t.  Really sucks when you’re 10 miles from the house and it feels like you are crawling on the way back and takes you 2-3 times longer and beeping at you the whole way.  Also, it is much more difficult to ride at slower speeds.  It takes a lot more energy out of you with the additional effort it takes to ride it.  You are going to be a lot more tired when you get back.  In hindsight, I would have purchased a different wheel with more speed and battery.  I just didn’t realize how much time or fun I was going to be having while riding it.  I love my EUC.  It truly is a blast to ride.  One of the best entertainment purchases I’ve ever made.  I’m still undecided on my next wheel.",

          "content": "This is my first electric unicycle. I upgraded from an inexpensive electric skateboard in order to find something that 1) can handle the steepest of San Francisco hills, 2) can handle the terrible road surface in some areas of the city, and 3) has a decent range. \n\nThis EUC does all of those things. It can go up and down the steepest hill in Potrero without issue. The cracks and potholes that stopped my electric skateboard in it's tracks are damped out by the V8. The range is exceptional. \n\nMy two complaints: \n\n1) The tire was misaligned on the rim at first, which I didn't think to check since I never had to check on a bicycle. This caused some significant instability of the V8 at higher speeds, leading to oscillations and many near-crashes. Deflating the tire significantly and ensuring it was centered on the wheel during and after reinflation fixed this issue for me. I wish this had been a standard warning from the get go. \n\n2) When I grab the handle of the V8, I oftentimes scrape my knuckles to the point of bleeding. There is a seam directly under the handle, and sliding your fingers in and out in order to grip the handle catches this seam and sometimes rips off some skin. I put a small strip of clear duct tape over this area to prevent this. Very unpleasant. \n\nOverall a good electric unicycle. Performs well in San Francisco rain (aka barely a drizzle, but wet roads), was easy to learn, and the top speed is just about what I'm comfortable with as a beginner. I had to take off a star for the seam-finger issue though. I still recommend this to others.",

After doing quite a bit of research both on the right EUC (eg for beginners) and who to buy from, I landed on the Glide 3 as well as purchasing from eWheels.  I did most of my research via YouTube.  What I found basically was that the Glide 3 was a good introductory EUC at a price point that wasn't a barrier.  Not too fast/powerful, but just right.  Very smooth and easy to learn on.  Plus, the fact that a cover comes with the Glide 3 is a plus.  While I was learning, I can't tell you how many times I \"dumped\" (eg had to hop off) the Glide 3.\n\nWith respect to eWheels, a lot of the prominent YouTubers, w.r.t. EUCs, spoke highly of eWheels.  So, after doing my research, I felt comfortable investing in my first EUC with eWheels.   Jason was also quick to answer questions that I had.\n\nAfter about three weeks, though, I've already invested in a 2nd EUC.  My 13 yr old son has enjoyed learning to ride as well.

          "content": "At first i was apprehensive and i think i lacked a little confidence. I rode it about a hundred feet on my second try but quit there because i couldnt get it to speed up. I've ridden pedal unicycles all my life ( Im 54 now) and the forward backwards balance is no problem on the glide 3 but the side to side was.  The next morning I put a lot more air in the tire (15 more lbs) to 55. I got on it and leaned a little further forward and off i went!  I had read that riding one with lower tire pressure is easier to control and its simply not true.  It decreases the lean forward to go faster and virtually eliminates high speed wobs. Its truly an amazing vehicle and has just the right amount of speed.  Im not afraid of speed by any means but for the tire size its the perfect comfort zone  at speed for stability and you pass every cyclist, especially uphill. Im a fairly big guy at 190 and it has no problem buzzing me up a long uphill straightaway that would be a long and arduous haul for even a healthy experienced bicyclist. The roads are pretty rough where I live but there are no major potholes which could be detrimental to your health but I biffed it around the corner pretty good and it takes a pretty good beating.  Although I'm sure I could handle a short staircase I'm not sure i would put it through that kind of abuse and expect it to last over 1000 miles without a major overhaul and repairs. It might but why risk it.  Its a great machine. Treat it with respect and it will do everything it says milagewise and speedwise.  The battery pack appears to be quite healthy.   The app sucks and it takes a little to figure the lights. Its headlight is bright but at speed its iffy, so i wear a 500 lumen lamp on my helmet at night.  You youngsters out there wear your damn helmet because you are going to fall hard at speed.  Trust me I know. Lol . All in all I made a great decision on my purchase because Ewheels company gave me an education in itself on all of the eunicycles and the one that would suit my abilities best. I'm no slouch and am in good shape with the athleticism it takes to ride one and it suits me perfect.  I give it a five out of five so far with only about 60 miles on it so far.  Thanks guys I love it far more than I thought I thought would.   For what it does you simply cant beat the price. Job well done....      Pete in Las Cruces NM",

I would highly recommend purchasing this wheel as a starter wheel and upgrading to see if a higher end wheel will suit your needs or not (you may get lucky and find a new release that blows away a wheel you were previously looking at). Not only that, but this wheel comes with a cover and wrist guards which adds value to the purchase and protects the wheel as you learn. The wheel itself is smooth and with time feels like second nature. You want to go somewhere? It'll take you there in a snap. Another great benefit is the button under the handle that keeps the wheel from spinning if you need to bring it up stairs (making it ideal for the city).\n\nThe reason why I marked this wheel down is due to battery capacity and higher end performance. The battery is good (comparable to a Onewheel XR [I enjoy riding with onewheel groups]), but it doesn't offer what similar level wheels offer. I wish Inmotion upgraded this wheel to a capacity similar to the Kingsong 16S so I get just a bit more range (maybe power too? :3). Performance-wise I can only go 15 mph on the wheel before pushback slows me down (making me much slower than my Onewheel companions). It makes catching up uncomfortable, because riding through pushback for a few miles can be exhausting on the feet and legs.\n\nThat being said, I (may be) pushing the limitations of the wheel in group rides, so I'll likely upgrade to a larger wheel. However, I did not know I needed more performance until I started joining groups! This wheel has made me more active than before, meeting more people than I have before. It will likely be my solo riding backup commuter since the benefits and convenience of this wheel make it great all-around easy cruising wheel. But, I digress since this wheel is priced at such a great point that I can't really complain too much! ;)\n\nSummary: This wheel is recommended as a super fun starter wheel or an urban/city commuter due to its convenience and features. However, if you're thinking of joining group rides, a higher performance wheel is recommended to keep up!",

Two, 2 hour sessions with the V8 Saturday and was up and running on a single floor in a multi-level car park. By end of second session - Smooth power, easy to mount, stopping no problem. Could ride this wheel all day! Was eying the (steep) ramps to the other floors in the car park. And “felt” that I would want to attempt them on the V10, all that safety talk about weight versus motor power on inclines got in my head... Sunday - got up on the V10, immediately felt “in the pocket” with this wheel. After an hour of adjusting foot position on the larger pedals I hit the ramps. By the end of that sessions I was running all six floors, and hitting the 16 mph warning often... Hindsight 20/20 - I think that if you are athletic and have skiing or snowboard experience the V10 is an OK entry point. Nothing wrong with the V8 at all - I look forward to riding it again to compare experiences. If I am heading to the coffee shop - V8, heading out for a run - V10... No falls or serious crashes - V8",

Still definitely learning but so far its pretty fun.  I will say that I was not prepared for just how quickly this thing would get beat up.  Its very sturdy and holding up to the punishment quite well but cosmetically (even with the cover) it got mangled very quick.  I've wiped out a few times  plus just normal tipovers as I'm learning, the floorboards underneath are scraped to hell and even on top around the handle where the cover doesn't cover has road rash.  In my case probably not a bad thing since it'll be less likely to be stolen but worth noting.  I don't think any other model/brand would have fared any better, it was just a surprise about how much abuse would occur.\n\nOther than cosmetics though the thing is a lot of fun.  Definitely not the easiest skill for me to pick up but its coming along.",

The following day I did a quick research and saw the inmotion V8 on amazon for 899 with excellent review. One of the review mentions buying it from ewheels.com and so thats what I did and Gheeze! This was such a crazy impulse buy that I have ever done. To think that I always wanted a road bike but will never pay more than 300 bucks  and to dropped 900 dollars without thinking twice, I must be crazy. At first I was little upset because I didn’t know how to ride and I kept dropping and scraping. It took me 1 week learn but after learning how to ride I love it more and more. Best thing is no one in my neighborhood has one so I feel super special. If you’re a first time like I was the solo glide 3 is an excellent choice.",

          "content": "I used the \"contact us\" link to ask for advice on what to purchase after reading numerous positive reviews on forum.electricunicycle.org. I'm 5'-8\", 155lbs, mid 40s and I've been reading about EUCs ever since I stumbled upon them after initially looking for an adult razor type scooter. Jason got back quickly and recommended the Glide 3 which I bought the next day. I've never even used a segway so I knew it was going to be a learning curve. Over five days, about two hours per day, one or more days off in between, I've logged 40 miles now. First few days were hard, and this experience makes learning to snowboard seem easy. Anyway, I have some sore muscles below the knee that I never even knew existed, but I've gotten pretty good, even at slow speeds. I haven't bumped it above the factory 83% and I'm still trying to understand how the calibration settings work, but overall I love this thing. I've never even seen an EUC in person before but watched a lot of youtube videos over the past year, which probably helps with the learning curve. Anyway, I highly recommend this for a beginner or intermediate. The neoprene cover is nice and kept it from getting scratched the first few days. Yesterday I took the kids to the park and my 6 year old got tired riding her bike up hill on the way home. I grabbed one handle bar and her seat and this thing had enough power to easily push both of us up a nice long hill (ok, my back is a little sore from bending over a little). I almost bought a ninebot C but when I read about people upgrading, I'm glad I spent a little more. eWheels was super convenient and I got a shipping notice about two hours after I placed the order. I highly recommend both eWheels and the Glide 3!",

          "content": "Started my electric unicycle journey this year with Ninebot One E+, which I consider a great wheel. I have not ridden any other wheel than that. I wanted to have second wheel, more range, more speed and integrated handle. I also did not want it to emit loud high pitch noise and did not want it to be to heavy.\n\nFrom my internet research I had zero options... Then I heard about Inmotion V8 several weeks ago. The process of purchase was great. I ordered it one afternoon (4PM), it was sent next day early morning (got email of dispatch at 4AM).\n\nI also recommend getting this particular wheel, yet you have to ask yourself - if you have different expectations, then maybe some other wheel would suit you better. For me - V8 seems like, well, created for me :). I wanted a wheel:\n1. For commuting 10-12km one way, without having to recharge at work (to carry less things in backpack). V8 can do that.\n2. With more range for more fun and more options. With E+ I sometimes needed to go taxi one way, and unicycle the other way because of not enough range for my needs. Now I'm able to go 34km (did 33.6km once with 5% battery left, going around 23-25kph).\n3. With integrated handle, so that I can go inside a shop etc. V8 has it, I like it very much, checked in practice inside shop - it's great. Oh, and also this button which stops the motor when you lift V8 up - I did not realize how much it can simplify my life, very good idea and implementation.\n4. With more speed for more fun. I often felt (on E+) that I need just a little bit more speed. V8 has what I need and riding it feels really solid.\n5. Not too heavy - V8 is around the same weight as E+. In practice it felt lighter, so I checked on weighing machine and it showed it's really lighter (but I wouldn't trust this machine much).\n6. No high-pitch loud noise - V8 sound is really pleasant for my ears. I really appreciate LEDs (for me - the more the better :)). A friend told me the wheel looks like from Tron movie (on the predefined factory settings).\n\nThe driving is similar to E+, but pedals are a lot more stiffer (I use riding mode 0 on E+) and they also react totally different on turns. On E+ they dive in (firmware 1.3.5) on turns, here it's the opposite, so I had some small learning to do. I think I prefer the riding mode of V8 and turns of E+, but on the other hand - I'm just accustomed to that feeling so cannot judge as of now.\nI have nearly 3000km on E+ and nearly 300km on V8 and I believe that in the end I'll simply like both types of behaviours :).\n\nOh, and I forgot about look: this wheel is simply beautiful :). After spending some time with V8, commuting, going to shops, having fun - my opinion about it is very very positive.",

          "content": "You can get it in any color as long as it's black\" and that's about the only likeness the Inmotion V8 has with my old \"T-Ford\" wheel. I am a beginner to the electric unicycle and I was very hasty in the purchase of my first wheel: a 14-inch, generation 1 electric unicycle from a local shop. After a few hours of riding I realized that I had outgrown this wheel that caused pain to my shins and had limited potential. A brief but informative \"Let's Talk\" with Jason helped me make up my mind to place a pre-order. It took a few days extra to get the shipment since this was the first batch to Europe from the factory but it was very reassuring to get a notification from eWheels once it reached the continent. Delivery to me came four days later. I have to say that the V8 is a dream to ride and very responsive. It gives me no pain to my legs at all and I haven't even attached the supplied soft-pads. It handles the dirt roads in my training path with ease and the transition to the new wheel was quite a no-brainer. The only down-side I can find is that it is easy to accidentally toggle the power button when grabbing the handle while wearing gloves. OK, so it wouldn't hurt with a good back light either as the dark season is approaching but I found the front light to be very apt for my dark roads. Summary: top-notch wheel, top-notch dealer!",

          "content": "Going to a larger EUC\nMy Impressions on upgrading from a 14\" Inmotion V5F to 16\" V8\n\nI got my Inmotion V5F , catchy name huh, on March 30th 2017 and it took me 3 months 2 weeks to put 1000 miles on it. It was an upgrade from a Ninebot one A1, which served as my learning machine. So 14\" wheels are all I have ever known. I love the portability and toyishness of the 14\" under 30lbs wheels. They prepare you to get bounced off by their very lack of mass and weight beneath your feet. I often wonder why I even need them to glide above the ground, and maybe they are just a crutch for this un-noticed skill I have had all along. Then I hit a hidden salad bowl sized pothole and wonder why I am running all of a sudden with my wheel skidding off to the side. They are fun! So when I decided to get more speed and distance I settled in on the 16\" Inmotion V8 for looks (really sleek even with the dizzy lights), the name (I am a car guy so V8), and the familiarity with the Inmotion ride.\nMore on the Inmotion V8 specs and review later. After getting the V8 calibrated with the app to unlock the speed and tweak the lights and warnings it was time to test ride. I had tried the 16\" and the 18\" wheels at a gas station during a brief meeting with my local EUC club. They were ACM and Kingsong models and really had a vehicle type of ride stability. They felt like firm machinery compared to my nimble V5F lark. The Kingsong 14S and 16S were not available yet to buy, but on another EUC ride I was fortunate enough to try out an 840wh Kingsong 14C from Jeff and found it to be more than capable at getting me up and down the hollywood hills in Griffith Park. It never labored and has great pick up in acceleration. It was a bit more clunky in the corners than my V5F, but that might have been Beginner Wheel Skill Disorder. BWSD is the term I give for the unwieldy feel that a new wheel will have until your body has adjusted to the different mechanics and foot weight distributions that arise from different wheels. This was what I was feeling with the new V8 as I ventured down my hill towards sunset blvd. It would pull to one side or the other in a different way from my old V5F. Perhaps it is learning my style as I learn its. The phenomenon is still the same if not more pronounced with a brand new out of the package wheel. Inmotion has a - SCV forward correction - function in its app that will work after about 10 miles of use. Other models have ride feel adjustments in their Apps, and it is suggested to dial in or use these functions as it will make the break in time more comfortable, and give you more control. This worked for me as well as my body was adjusting to the new geometry of the larger wheel.\nGoing up in wheel size doesn't make you taller, since the pedals are at the same height, but the body of the wheel will rest at different areas of your legs. I have a blister on my right upper ankle and a slight bruise on my left shin as evidence of this. The V8 is only 1\" taller than the V5F with a trolley handle. However the top of the body is 2\" taller. So for a short guy, the physics of leaning due to the taller y-axis(body) makes the leverage from the x-axis(pedals) less. My body either needs to lean out side to side further or with more force. Its not much more, but there does seem to be a natural learning curve. Combined with the additional weight of the wheel, these are some things to be aware of when upsizing, even within the same company. Obviously since all EUC companies have different designs, this happens when switching Wheel companies as well.\nI ride my V5F and V8 along the bike lanes and paths of Los Angeles. The streets in L.A. Bow up to drain water to the gutters and the bike lanes and space next to curbs is on a slight angle. This angle can force the wheel into the curb unless I ride the wheel at a little bit more than a 90° angle, leaning slightly into traffic. This has taken some adjustment and learning, so I have had to be more careful even though I have more than 1000 miles of riding experience. Turning is different, not better or worse as far as tightness of turns and control. The wobbles are back as the placement of my feet is adjusted to the new weight distribution, blabbity blah, blah. Enough of the first impressions, Lets skip 50 miles into the future...\nI really enjoy the 3mph extra cruising speed and max speed in the upgrade. I got to work within a few minutes of my car time average. The V8 feels both stable and nimble at cruising speeds of 15-19mph. The other day I rode over a bowl type of pothole that used to shake my 14\" wheel, but the 16\" took it in stride even while taking me by surprise. This is only day 3, but the wheel is beginning to learn my unorthodox extreme leaning into the curves. I am still getting used to the larger circumference while turning, because I am so used to the smaller wheel. Its getting much more natural with every new trip. Driving over shallow sand and loose dirt is easier with the heavier V8, but still a lot like dry water skiing. The 800 watt motor easily moves me uphills in dirt and asphalt or to maximum speed without laboring. I like to ride my EUC like a leaf balancing on a spinning top, and the V8 has that sort of stable lightness of a ride.\nI am only 145 lbs. but the V8 only gets around 21 or 22 miles, with pushing it to the limits and stopping for stop signs, before you reach the dreaded last bar or 20% battery left. The speaker which usually blurts out \"be careful\" (gotta get it to speak in Chinese) gives you a warning sound that sounds like the warning sound you'd get when a landline telephone used to get knocked off the hook for too long if you start to push it at this point. It limits the speed and gets a little cranky if you jump off a curb or over a large pothole at a fast speed under these battery conditions. All in all it wants the rider to be safe and reminds you of this a lot when the battery gets very low. Although the range is a little lacking, it took me around two hours to drive 22 miles. A 2 min stop to change out a new battery for another 22 miles is no big deal, and probably needed as a rest at that point anyway. Changing the battery in the V5F is a great undertaking requiring great feats of double speed fast motion photography, unscrewing and unhooking for 15 mins just to get to the battery compartment and unhook it. So get the V5F+ if you are thinking of range for that EUC. I have already ordered an extra battery for the V8 and charging port to hook it up to my chargers.\nTo sum it all up, upgrading to a wheel to match ones skill level and expanded use is something enriching and easy to do. The options are all around and so far seem to be growing in numbers. I stuck with what was familiar but larger and more powerful. If Kingsong had their KS14S or KS16S available I may have gone with them. One thing to remember- you will use the new wheel in much the same way as the old one for the majority of the time. It should make these journeys more useful and enjoyable. If you can say that about your upgrade, you've succeeded. Some other brief thoughts...\n- I thought the larger 16\" wheel would be more cumbersome- it is actually just as nimble\n- I had no idea how the extra speed would be so natural during the proper conditions. You don't miss what you don't experience...\n- Upgrading to a new wheel takes time to relearn some basic handling of the new machine.",

          "content": "I have been researching online and on you tube for several months now on purchasing an electric unicycle, and I finally decided on an Inmotion V8, and decided to purchase from EWheels instead of eBay or ( Amazon, I could only find the V5F there), Due to the Reviews about Jason and the service there.\n\nFirst let me say the three reasons I went with the V8...\n\n1. A more intermediate wheel with power and range I felt like I could grow into, I was afraid I would want to purchase another one in a few months :) maybe not the worst scenario ...\n\n2. The many videos on You Tube that showed and reviewed this wheel all were extremely positive...\n\n3. The only bells and whistles I wanted were the lights and a built in handle and that's it, no speakers etc...\n\nSecondly let me talk about EWheels ...\n\nI placed my order on Friday night March 24th, I ordered the V8 and extra inner tube (I live in AZ lots of pokez (cactus) on the roads as my grandkids would say) and a cover for the V8. First thing Monday morning 3/27 I received an email from Jason at EWheels with a lot of really good information about getting started and links to videos and the app and a message about my order, apparently they were out of the covers and Jason let me know immediately which I thought was extremely proactive and was definitely the right thing to do from a customer experience standpoint, he also promised to send some of the bumper padding at no cost and refund the cost of the cover if he was unable to locate a cover for me. Later that day he sent me another email verifying that he was indeed out of the covers and that he would refund and send me the padding in lieu of the cover. Again I really appreciate his upfront heads-up and short term solution for my order, I really feel like his focus was on making me a happy camper right out of the gate :).\n\nNow the Wheel... wow what can I say except AWESOME!!! it arrived at my house on Thursday 3/30 around noon with an 80% charge and everything in the box packed well and no damage whatsoever :) On Friday I started practicing doing the various things a newbie would do after watching countless hours of video on YouTube lol... I expected I wouldn't even be able to ride it until I practiced for at least one to two weeks for one to two hours a day well guess what :) some how I was able to get the hang of it within that first hour and yea I still need lots of practice but I have been cruising around the neighborhood and even my kids are amazed that I caught on this quick. Now I do have to tell you it was not with some major spills and crashes but I wear the necessary gear (Wrist, knee, elbow and helmet) and yes I have already scratched up the outside not to bad, but if I would have only had the cover on it, it actually would have been worse. Once I get much better I will order a new case anyways but for now the padding is doing its job.\n\nThe only negatives about the wheel for me anyways, was the lack of a pad for the upper calf area however I used some of the padding to solve that for now, it did come with some ankle pads which for me were needed :), and the app which I expected based on the reviews I read.\n\nI will be doing business with Jason and EWheels in the future for replacement parts for the V8 and some accessories. And I'm sure there will be an upgrade in the future to a Gotway maybe a monster :) but for now I am extremely happy with my purchase and with the excellent service provided by Jason,\n\nHopefully I can get some of the videos uploaded soon to you tube.\n\nThanks EWheels,\n\nDanny (Poopa) Thornton",

It took me about 2 hours to feel comfortable going forward and making tight turns. I have put 60 miles on since January 4th when I received my wheel and really enjoy riding it. I have no other wheels to compare my experience but I can say I am impressed with the power and the range so far. I can easily see myself riding an 18 inch wheel with a long range battery by summer 2018. I live in Pennsylvania and I have never seen one of these around but glad I discovered these cool inventions.\n\nThe customer service here is top notch. Jason answered all my questions very fast and everything went smooth. I ordered a cover for the V8 but I received one for a V5. Jason responded with a tracking number for the new cover and a shipping label to return the one for the V5. I received the correct cover in 4 days. Again, I cannot say enough about the customer service here. Overall I would rate my experience a 5 out of 5. Look forward to making another purchase in the future!",

The only bad point would be the \"new\" side pads.  I like the older side pads - they have more padding where it's needed most and the upper padding edge is more \"rounded\" so as to place less pressure on the side of my shin during mounting and dismounting.  The new pads have a sharp upper edge that digs into my shin like a dull knife and after a few mounts/dismounts make my shin begin to REALLY HURT.  I have version 2.00 firmware in my wheel, and when I disable the bluetooth speaker, the wheel will announce \"Blah-tooth is off\" everytime I power up my wheel.

The amount of power is great, 800 Watts is more than enough for me. As far as customer service goes, ewheels is perfect. Jason helped me along the with my concerns.

The motor controller board hasn't overheated yet, so now I can go up the same hills and not worry about having to step off. \n\nThe side pads seem to be polarizing, but I didn't mind them. I received the new flatter ones but didn't install it on one of the wheels because they aren't uncomfortable to me. \n\nI cannot stand the \"Hello King Song\" and \"Bluetooth Connected\" sounds. There is no way to disable those in the app or through any settings. It's super embarrassing and stupid, but oh well. The rest of the wheel more than makes up for it.",

I logged over 400 miles on that wheel and really needed a wheel that was faster for commuting to work and being able to ride longer distances if needed.  I spoke with Jason about the pros and cons of the different wheels and companies several times.  I like the specs on Gotway but KingSong has a reputation for reliability and I would be using this wheel everyday.  My choices came down to the KS 16S or KS 14S.  When I decided to buy, the 16S was out of stock so I went with the 680 wh KS 14S.  Shipping was so fast and everything was intact when delivered (Thanks eWheels). I opened the packaging and put the wheel on the charger to get a full charge.  The wheel came with a decent charge out of the box. What a night and day difference between the S1 and 14S, this is a super fun and very fast wheel.  I just logged over 300 miles with this wheel and cant express how satisfied I am with my purchase of the KS 14S.  My son has been riding my S1 for the past two weeks and I finally let him take a ride on the 14S and he was blown away by the sheer power and speed. He kept asking how I hold back from zooming past him when we ride together since it is so smooth and quick. Even in strong wind, the 14S pushes through without any issues. I replaced the factory pads with the smooth ones sent from Jason at eWheels and what a huge difference did it make.  It made the wheel so much more enjoyable. The headlight is bright enough to see when riding at night.  The brake light is also a nice addition.  The integrated trolley handle is really nice and necessary as the wheel weighs 34 pounds.  All I can say is this is a awesome EUC that is fast and fun and a pleasure to ride.  eWheels is the only company I will buy from since they have quality products, helpful staff, and awesome warranty.  No other company in the US comes close.",

Jason was very helpful in answering my questions and when I purchased it from him I received it in less than a week. Jason provides great follow-up information and he is a pleasure to do business with. The 14S is a fantastic wheel. It has plenty of power and runs very fast. I can reliably get over 30 miles on one charge (my riding weight is ~170 pounds). Here’s a video I shot in my local Southern California mountains, showing it’s off-road prowess: https://youtu.be/qrRLyR0R0jI The full length video can be seen here: https://youtu.be/7x5uo-9k3nQ I don’t think you can go wrong with either the 14S or eWheels.com",

          "content": "I recently purchase the KS 14S from ewheels.com and I wanted to share my experience with others who might be debating about which EUC to purchase.\nThe last couple of years I’ve been trying out a variety of electric vehicles for recreation and transport including a Boosted Board, OneWheel, Segway mini pro, and a Metroboard. All have been fun, but I have sold them all off except for the Onewheel. I liked the Boostedboard, but I wasn’t into to small wheel size and having to use a remote. I did not like controlling the Mini Pro with my knees…it did not feel natural. I liked the OneWheel’s ability to go off road, but the 6 mile range was limiting and prevented me from using it as a commuter vehicle.\nI decided to try out an electric unicycle and went with the KS 14C. I purchased the 840wh/800W Motor. I felt that my experience with the OneWheel helped me pick up the KS 14 pretty quickly. It took me a couple of days to feel comfortable, but after that, I really enjoyed this wheel. Compared to the Onewheel, I felt the the 14C was easier to dismount. The OneWheel has a sensor on the foot plate that can be tricky. The 14S allows for easy mounting and dismounting without a problem. The 14” wheel took the grass and bumps a little easier than the 10” OneWheel tire. The range is another thing that really separates the 14S from the other vehicles I have tried. Running out of battery is not a fear on the 14S. The fast charger from eWheels makes the charging experience very convenient as well. I’m not saying the Onewheel or any of the other rideables are bad at all, but I find the KS 14S suits my needs a lot better. I like the 14S so much, I’ve decided to sell my OneWheel and buy a KS 18. I just want to say that Jason at eWheels gave me the best customer service. He answered all of my questions and answered many of my emails after hours and even on the weekends. The whole experience was great and I highly recommend a KS from eWheels.com.",

I went on a 15-mile ride with my buddy who owns an MSuper 18 and was outpacing him the entire way. The app customization options are great too – no one wants to hear beeping as they go faster.

Every time I ride a friends wheel its always refreshing to jump back on the 18s. There is nothing like except the monster. Sit riding is so nice and a totally different feel than standing. Its like riding a moped with no handlebars. Amazing feeling of freedom.  So much safer than a onewheel with multiple safety features that protect a bigger rider like me from nose diving.  I weigh 275 LB and this thing takes me at fast speeds for hours.  Do yourself a favor and get the bigger battery. I didn't realize how much I needed it until my friend got a 70 mile wheel and that gave me range anxiety.  When they come in I will be upgrading the battery by adding another one.

Get the highest battery version or you'll regret it as you'll need to charge from 30-80%. You don't want to demolish your expensive battery. If you've ridden before you'll have no problem riding this and getting up to speed will only take 10-20 high speed runs until your body figures it out. Buy the wrap around padding. Just do it. Trust me. The stock padding doesn't cover but 50% of the area your leg will hit on the wheel and you will need to rest your leg on this wheel unlike smaller wheels. Hmmm what else....... Buy motorcycle armor/a helmet/knee pads if you value your life even a little bit. This thing doesn't exactly stop on a dime and at 31mph I can imagine a big enough pothole/bump bucking you off. While seated, stopping takes twice as long and standing up quickly to stop can be difficult. This is the future, you want this Wheel, 2k feels very reasonable for what you get (even more so if you're replacing your car with this/the bus like I am. Speakers are plenty loud.

          "content": "Let me give you a little background.  I had been using a simple hoverboard as an \"assistant commuter.\"  I would ride it from my house to a commuter train and then from there I would ride it again to work.  I had done this for a year, but the reality of this being so slow for a few of the miles I was on it set in very quickly.\nI was looking for other options that were all electric and also very fun. I had already been known at work and around the work neighborhood as the guy with the hoverboard and somewhat even infamous.  I wanted to ramp it up a notch too with whatever I decided to upgrade to.  I looked into eBikes and then saw a video on YouTube about Electric Unicycles.  As soon as I saw that video, which was for a really cheap and under powered EUC, I knew that I needed to get one.  I started researching what types were available, cost, power, speed, battery size, mileage, etc.\nI settled on either a Gotway Monster 22 or a KingSong KS18S because of the power and mileage capability.  I wanted this to be able to be a full commuter and errand runner.  This would become my primary form of transportation, so it had to be top of the line!  I quickly realized the price for me was high, but definitely worth the cost.  I saved up what I could and even sold some things on eBay to get all the money.  After watching nearly all the videos that are on YouTube about EUCs in general while the time passed, I finally found out about eWheels as the best vendor here in the USA.  I also, during this research, finally decided on the KingSong KS18S, as my biggest priorities were, in this order, distance, safety, quality, and power.  I've found that overall opinion out there is that KingSong, has the best safety and quality ratings of all the EUC vendors.  So I ordered it through eWheels and now I just had to wait for it to arrive.\n\nThree days!  That's all it took to get from California to Utah.  By the way, there's almost no one in Utah with an EUC, so I may even be the only KS18S rider in the state.  That needs to change, we need enough to form a group.\n\nSo here's my experience.  I had no experience on one, so it was entirely up to me to train myself.  I did watch many videos of how to ride one on YouTube, but they only gave my brain the knowledge.  I was VERY UNSUCCESSFUL on my first attempt.  Never once though did my EUC fall or get scratched.  I was extra cautious.  On day two, I was able to ride it, but couldn't quite control where it went, obviously not desirable.  After three days however, it finally clicked in my head somehow and WOW, I was riding an EUC.\nIt was actually only about 3 or 4 hours of trying to ride it as I spent mostly only about an hour each day practicing.  I had no serious falls or close calls, but being tense and inexperienced had me really squeezing the EUC with my knees which caused some minor bruises on both the inside of my knees and ankles.\nOnce I got it down I didn't find much need to squeeze the sides unless I wanted a really quick acceleration or I was climbing a steep hill.  Which this one has NO problems at all doing.  I've mostly ridden it in downtown Salt Lake City and drove it up and down some really serious inclines without any problems.\n\nI've seen some reviews both written and video saying that the KingSong KS18S is NOT a good EUC for beginners.  If that's true then I'm an exceptional rider.  But statistically there shouldn't be anything special about me, so I would say it's a great beginner EUC as it is a top of the line model.  Which means it has plenty of power when you're trying something that you don't know that you shouldn't try as a beginner.  It will NOT cut out suddenly! \nI would recommend this for beginners who have never ridden an EUC, but only IF they have the budget available.\nThis is day four of me riding the KS18S and I already have 45 miles on it and that almost entirely yesterday's distance.  This has quickly become my favorite form of transportation.  \nA special note about learning to ride though; if you want to learn quickly, then you will need to be in good shape.  If you take it slowly then it doesn't require as much out of you physically.  I use an Apple Watch to keep track of steps, movement, heart rate, etc. which I use to meet certain exercise goals.  I blew all those goals out of the water while I was trying to learn it.  Four times as many calories burned; three times as much movement; and twice the exercise were the results of learn this awesome machine.\n\nThe KingSong KS18S is an EUC that shouldn't be passed on if you've got the chance.  I really love the distance, speed and power that comes with this alternate form of travel that has now become my favorite form of travel.",

(actually, the issues I had on my faulty one-off KS18A was how I befriended Jason of eWheels ^^)\nWhile I enjoy the cult status and rarity this wheel has, as most people prefer shorter, more prettier and blinky-LED kind of EUC wheels, don't let that fool you: this is a workhorse wheel in one of my favorite tall form factors. In all my EUC ownership of all major brands and various shapes and sizes, the KS18, in whatever version, will probably always be a fixture in my EUC rotation, and the only way to ensure A+ US support in such a wheel investment is to buy it from eWheels.com.",

I have right at 500 miles on this wheel and have enjoyed every single ride that I have taken. I and bigger. When I first received the wheel, I could not believe the size difference between the 14s and the 18s. At first it was intimidating wheel just off the sheer size but once I took my first ride, I was hooked and this became my favorite wheel. It is not as nimble as the 14s, but when you cruise, the 18s is so stable at higher speeds and takes road imperfections so much better you don't mind it not being as nimble. But with practice, you can ride with pedestrian traffic without any issues. I get so much attention with this wheel due to the unique shape and sheer speed of the EUC. I bought a motorcycle jacket, gloves, and helmet for added safety since I have to ride on the street since a lot of streets don't have sidewalks that are continuous. I haven't had any issues with either of my King Song EUC's. I trust them and stand by their safety reputation. I attend bike night at the local motorcycle shop bought a King Song 14s in December and wanted another wheel for cruising that was faster and get so much attention from the bikers. I put two 140 lumen red lights that can flash on the trolley handle so I can be seen in the day as well as at night. The speakers are awesome and sound really loud without distortion. The headlight is bright and the taillight is big and bright and lights when you brake. Once again, I am amazed at the quality of this EUC and look forward to riding this wheel for many days to come. I highly recommend this wheel if you want speed, reliability, comfort, and fun!!!   Thank you Jason McNeil for the excellent recommendation on getting this EUC.  Big shot to eWheels for super fast shipping and excellent customer service!!  I will be buying all my EUC's from eWheels!!",

I purchased the biggest battery and I can say that this thing goes forever. At 6’3″, I’m still not getting the hang of the seated ride,but my children have no problem at all riding on the seat. For an 18 in. wheel, the pedal hardness is outstanding. It is very responsive at accelerating and breaking. It climbs hills very well. The automating headlights and break lights are a key feature. Speakers are a great feature as well. If you take longer rides, I highly recommend this wheel. Jason at ewheels is the best. I have no reason to shop anywhere else. I will be buying more wheels from him.",

I’ve been riding electric skateboards for years but, the first time I saw an electric unicycle, oh man, I just got the concept right away. NOTHING compares to the level of freedom and the natural feel that unicycle will give you. Being annoyed with my skateboard’s limitation of only being able to run on smooth terrain, I was in the market for an off road electric skateboard, that’s when I discovered the electric unicycle. No skateboard will ever match the flexibility and the ability and the speed to traverse as much different terrain as my 18’’ wheeled King Song. After much looking around and shopping, I found eWheels to have the best selection/price on the internet. Additionally, I want to mention that dealing with eWheels has been a sheer pleasure. I’ll spare you the long story but, let me just say that the kind of honesty, integrity and honor this place operates under is not always demonstrated by on-line vendors.

Once your muscle memory gets locked in, it is no longer a wheel you control, it is a magic carpet responding to your very thoughts.  I agree on the durability factor.  Those first sessions and a healthy dose of fear saw me leaping off of the machine as I watched it clatter and scrape to a stop.  It survived all of my temporary abandonments and actually still looks pretty decent (all black is a good color to hide the scrapes).  Several months later and after many accumulated miles, I can dance to the music from my phone spinning and swaying with the beat, maneuver the wheel in very tight spaces and feel the thrill of flying at top speed.  I have taken recently to hopping off curbs and catching some air going over speed bumps.  I have never gotten close to running the battery down as it goes for hours.  One more detail, I am almost 63 years old.  I bought this to challenge myself and it has become second nature to cruise in the neighborhood and up to the local school yard to further hone my riding skills on smooth tarmac and lumpy soccer fields.  A very cool thing to own and master.  While I have not fallen seriously over these last several months (only went down once at very low speed during session 3-scraped palm of a wrist guard and a bruise on the hip), I am not keen on riding without a good set of knee, elbow, & wrist guards and my bike helmet.  No point inviting disaster by riding free for the little money it takes to get a good and comfy set of protective pads.  If you are in reasonably good shape, you can do this activity and it is really like no other.  The 16S is an impressive and elegant piece of technology.",

I documented my journey learning on it and I think Jason and the entire eWheels company is doing a fantastic job providing excellent old school customer service that is honest and reliable.  The wheel is nimble, its speed is enough for my needs at the moment and it handles a lot of different type of terrain very well. I suggest Hard mode once you get comfortable on the device, the wheel feels more easier to ride. I will def be picking a new wheel in the future from these guys.

The blue tooth range is HORRIBLE, although I realize that most people will have their phone in their pocket or person while riding, so not an issue, I left mine on table nearby as I didn't want to fall and crush my phone.   Disconnected music after just a few feet.    Is very sturdy, can't count the number of times dropped, scrapped, went flying across the driveway, but still keeps on ticking.   Can't wait to get a few more miles on it.",

It rides smoothly and comfortably over long distances while still maintaining an aggressive edge when you ask for it.  The matte black finish is super stylish and I love that I can play music while riding (I do wish the speakers were a bit louder for noisy environments but its hardly a complaint).  Its much heavier than my previous wheel but the luggage handle makes that a non-issue in most situations.  I also love having the direct customer support from e-wheels as getting questions answered has been super easy (something I don't take for granted in this niche market).",

Acceleration is great, I often beat cars off the line up until around 15mph! Surprising amount of power up the ridiculous hills where I live too. Can take me up while cruising 18mph no problem. Also, King Song trolley handles are the bees knees. The only thing I don't totally dig is the side pads. I don't like how far they stick out - if the pedals were just set slightly wider, that would be nice. The contact point is also a little low - a taller wheel distributes the load along your leg better, which is more comfortable for mounting/dismounting or one-legged riding. These are relatively minor quibbles. This is a great wheel to have around. Due to where I frequently ride, I've found myself more comfortable on a wheel capable of ~25mph+ so that I can ride in traffic when necessary. Cyclists here are just super unpredictable, and passing them can be pretty dangerous. That said, I do wear CE rated knee and elbow impact protection, wrist guards, and a full face helmet. I still like having this for fun little rides - it's just so zippy!",

The higher torque holds the pedals rock solid -- gives a very strong sense that the wheel isn't going to let you fall. The additional range is just nice to have, knowing I can tool around at lunch and not have to worry about range. \n\nMy only reason for going 4 stars not 5 is the app. SO SKETCHY. Not in google's playstore. The app asks for so many permissions on the phone. Does it really have to have all that access just to unlock the wheel and set a few parameters.

I prepared to go for my first ride in Canada.  I left my hotel room and went to pick up the euc to go down the stairs  when the handle broke off.  Before  I had a chance to react, the euc went tumbling down the stairs.  The euc  was still operational but the handle was left in my hand.  I realized just how handy and convinient the handle is.  Therefore, I will have to order a new handle when I get back to the States.  I will also be ordering the larger pedals.  \nConcerning the app, its terribly frustrating to use.  Though  I have gotten use to it.  One problem  I'm having is the Km left to go. It keeps going back to 74km when I turn the unit on.  I currently  have close to 400 miles.

With the KS16S, once I was able to unlock the top speed, it's just a joy to ride as fast as I want to, as the top speed of 35 kph is definitely faster than I personally want to go on any of these devices.\n\nSo downsides: first the software is clumsy.  eWheels does a good job, I really appreciate the email that they sent with getting started information and details to help mitigate how confusing the software situation.  I ultimately installed the suggested older version of the Android software on my phone to speed unlock the machine, then WheelLog (now WheelInfo) app for more common use.  But expect to require some patience and at least a little frustration en route.\n\nSecond, I hear a high pitched sound from this machine when it's turned on, even when it's at rest, and it's louder when it's being used.  This isn't a deal killer for me, but it's unfortunately.  I presume that I'll get used to it.  It makes more typical EUC motor noise as well, no problem at all there, it's a pretty modest sound really.  But my other EUCs don't make this kind of high pitched sound.  Reading online I see that others report the same thing, so I don't think this is unique to my unit.\n\nThe machine arrived very well packed from the factory, and whiles software and documentation seem to be an after-thought, the hardware is great.   Okay, one other thing that probably just reflects my ignorance --- from my other lower speed and lower power units, I had this fantasy that with the KS16S it would just easily power up any hills I want to go up with zero deceleration or struggle.  It certainly does better at this than the other units, but I find that if I approach a fairly steep hill with little speed/momentum, I cannot accelerate up the hill to anywhere near the top speed of the unit, and I'm not a particularly heavy guy (or at least not heavy by U.S. standards? :-)) --- I weigh perhaps 165 pounds (75 kilos).\n\nIn my initial testing, I found that the unit handles reasonably packed gravel just fine.  Riding on compacted bark was a little more tedious, but do-able.   I like the no-nonsense approach of how it just turns on without any fuss or drama, ditto turning it off, and the recharging port is very easy to access (unlike the one on my IPS i5 which takes a bit more fiddling).    I had thought that I wouldn't be interested in the flashing side lights, but they are kind of cool --- for now at least, I'm keeping them on!  In my initial 13 km of riding the battery power (displayed using lights) hasn't budged, and I really like the idea that for any reasonable distance that I ever might want to ride, I'll have plenty of excess battery capacity (range) to get me there.    And of course, I very much like the reported safety and quality of King Song unicycles, though I have nothing personal I can contribute to either of those factors, at least at this point.\n\nBottom line is that I'm pleased with this and look forward to riding a lot more to get more comfortable with this particular unit and its capabilities and 'feel'.",

          "content": "I am a customer from Calgary Alberta Canada, I ordered a silver KS16S when the units were all on back-order. Jason and his team have amazing customer service, email updates every step of the way,  Realistic and accurate expectations for ETA. A very detailed and helpful email startup guide was also sent prior to receiving the wheel. \n\nThe wheel shipped on the 8th, I got the wheel May 10th 2018, Everyday ive been riding this, and each time i try and double the riding distance. On May 13th I put on 80km in one day (short recharge in the middle of the day). Learning wasn't nearly as hard as i though it would be. My recommendation is finding a flat open field of grass (soccer field), that way if you fall off, the wheel doesn't get damaged, its also good for learning the limits of how far you can lean and how sharp you can turn. Learning to ride on grass is harder, but when you transition to pavement its a piece of cake. I also recommend learning low speed precision control before going out where there is lots of people. \n\nI did a ridiculous amount of research before i chose the KingSong, i am very glad i picked this one, even after riding it and watching more youtube videos, i still think this is the best wheel for the money. I only wish it had a power cut button under the handle for going up stairs but i just turn off the power all together, no big deal. The range and power on this wheel is just perfect, i cant think of changing it to anything else that would be a noticeable improvement. The kingsong app is horrendous but it really does not affect the wheel since your normal running app can be darknessbot or wheellog.\n\neWheels is Top Tier in my opinion, if you are on fence buying from this shop, just do it, you will not regret it.",

After speaking with Jerry over the phone, I decided to purchased a Kingsong 16s with his recommendation. It took some time to recieve the wheel, which was not in stock at the time. Eventually, it did arrive and I have to say without dispute that the purchase is well worth the $1299. It is sleek and remarkable. I love it and though I have not yet mastered it to ride backward, I was able to ride it with confidence after a few hours of practice. The guys at ewheels.com are professionals and pay attention to ensure customer service. Thank you for your advice and help. I definately will purchase my next EUC from ewheels.",

The main features of an EUC which affect its safety are the power (power equals stability for a EUC) and reliability. 16s is the top at both of them (the failure rate of 16s is less than 1% since the beginning of sales in spring 2017). \n18s is also a very nice and even more powerful device, but it's much larger and higher and not comfortable for some riders and some applications.\n16s may soon be challenged by the new Kingsong model 18L, but for now there's really no competition. No other manufacturer even gets any close. \nI've made more than 2500 miles on a 16s since July and still absolutely happy with the thing, not a slightest hiccup so far. \nAnd for those who never used an EUC. This is NOT a toy like hoverboards and even segways, this is a fantastic personal urban transport, the best one invented so far. \nPS: Do NOT buy older Kingsong models (\"A, B, C\" models). They are total crap. Buy ONLY \"S\" and \"L\" models.",

I called Jason just to make sure I'm making the right decision and he assured me I will love it. Boy, was he right!! Now being much more educated, I'm really happy I did bought this one too... as of today I own 4 different unicycles and I have something to compare it to. KingSong 16S is definitely my number one choice, in fact other 3 will probably be sold and I'm planning on buying another KingSong. This wheel is solid and  refined, it is fast, powerful, thus making it safe, having enough power to \"get You out of a hole\" without power cutouts I feel much safer on it than any other wheel I have ridden.  If You are first time buyer You will NOT be disappointed!\nThis thing is such a joy, I'm definitely hooked on EUC's!!!",

I like that I can carry it using the handle without the wheel being turned on. Very straightforward operation and the pedals are great. But you have to be careful to keep the charging port rubber cap closed and it comes off easily if touched. Have not had problems though. I am hoping servicing / fixing flats is not too difficult. It's possible to do tight turns, but the pedal clearance is not as high as that on V8. Not that it matters much, it has not hindered after I adjusted my technique and the pedals really are awesome. So far, highly recommend and hope to have a great year ahead.",

          "content": "Just what I needed\nI came across these EUC things on YouTube about a year ago and couldn’t get them out of my mind. Finally bought one in Nov. 2017; KingSong 16s. Definitely nervous about such a\nlarge $ purchase on something that might prove to be nothing more than a novelty (or a complete disaster). I went for it anyway. I needed something to get me out of the house, that didn’t’ require me to go someplace else to use it, give me a sense of of adventure, exhilaration and dare I say put a smile on my face. The KingSong 16s has exceeded my expectations. I’ve also enjoyed the learning curve – a sense of genuine accomplishment in the real world where tactile and physical forces are the name of the game. There’s nothing like spending the 1st several hours doing nothing but crashing every few feet to wobbling along for a few yards, then finally being able to cautiously make it down the street. I’ve since logged over 100 miles and now I’m feeling like a super hero flying around town, up and down hills, on and off of sidewalks, and taking sharper and sharper turns with ease and precision. Recently I joked with Jason at eWheels that they should consider starting an EUC Anonymous group to begin addressing the addictiveness of these machines. Seriously, riding around and improving my skills is all I want to do anymore. So, about the KingSong 16s; fast, has great acceleration, nimble, durable, cool features, and has an overall sense of quality about it. The 16s is not a toy, it’s a serious machine for folks that are interested in getting out of the norm and experiencing the cutting edge of fun! Customer service has been excellent via Jason at eWheels. I will be buying my next EUC from eWheels – no doubt.",

No buyer’s remorse yet, Only downside is bruised calves but that is a right of passage of euc newbies. Also laid the wheel down and scratched it within the first hour but that comes with the territory. The ordering process was quick and painless. I ordered late in the evening on Monday and was riding around on it by Wednesday. Packaging was good and it came with a couple freebees (bumper pads and wrist guards, much appreciated). Buy some 3M double sided tape though since the included tape with the bumpers isn’t very good. Would purchase from Jason again.",

The purchase experience could not have been better, the Wheel arrived promptly as ordered in perfect condition, and Jason sent some very helpful emails with all the information that I needed to get up and running right away.\nI spent a few hours over the course of three days in a large parking garage where I could lean against the walls and pillars to get my confidence up on the Wheel and was cruising around the parking garage unassisted (although a little shaky) on the third day, probably put in about four to five hours of work over the course of the three days to feel fairly confident in cruising around the parking garage.\nI have had the wheel a little over three weeks now and have logged about 160 miles on mostly wide bike paths and neighborhood roads. I could not be happier with my purchase experience and the King Song 16S model – – it has the power to handle my 6’2″ 225# frame with no problem. I have ridden up a two mile 6 – 7% grade hill near my home and the wheel has no problem lugging me right up to the top. I am also amazed how much battery regeneration occurs with this wheel when I go down long hills. I recouped close to 20% battery charge riding the wheel down a two mile hill, very impressive.\nI am having enough fun that I am starting to look at a second wheel option and when I figure out what I want for my second Wheel I will be purchasing it from Jason and eWheels for sure!",

The order shipped the same day and I received it 2 days later since I live in California and the wheel shipped from Los Angeles. Couldn’t be happier with the speed of order processing and shipment ! After you order, you get an informational message about the particular model you ordered with useful information to get you ready. This is really a nice touch and is sent in addition to the order receipt. When I received the order, the wheel was in perfect condition and actually looked better in real life than in pictures. I’ve had a chance to ride it a few times now and I say it’s really good upgrade path for Ninebot E+ owner, especially with regards to the range which from my initial experience looks to be about 3 times the range. I will be writing a more thorough comparison later that I will post to the forum.electricunicycle.org with the pros and cons of this model. This is a great site to buy EUC with complete confidence that you will get the service and support when you need it (and you will). eWheels answered all my questions pre and post purchase and he is very reputable among the EUC community. I’m 100% satisfied with the purchase that I have no trouble recommending this site to people I meet who are also looking to buy electric unicycle. Do not buy from random sources on the Internet where you won’t get warranty or support. eWheels will definitely have my repeat business in the future when I decide to upgrade again",

I wanted something that had enough battery to transport me to and fro, without worries of running out of power.  However, I needed something that was going to be durable enough to handle the rigors of urban dwelling.  (Rough streets and rude drivers.)  \n\nThe Dualtron 3 is larger and faster than most urban scooters, but I feel that while it's considered more of an \"off road,\" scooter, I like to think of it as being the perfect \"Urban Assault Scooter.\"  It handled steep grades with no problem. It too on uneven sidewalks and streets easily.  I came off of a moderate to high level curb, with enough clearance to feel comfortable about my scooter's capabilities, and kept rolling.\n\nThe speed, handling and suspension system of the Dualtron 3 make this a great urban scooter.  The beefy nature of the scooter build also makes me feel that it's the better choice for the commutes that I'll have to endure of days as well. And with proper care and maintenance, it should do so for a long time to come.\n\nIt's not a lightweight scooter that one will carry around in the office, or on public transit.  However, if you're using it as your main source of durable transportation, on city streets, to get to your destination and back again, one can't go wrong with the Dualtron 3.",

          "content": "First off, thank you Jason from eWheels for answering all my emails promptly and for all the info regarding purchasing and using this scooter. I was a little hesitant in ordering such an expensive scooter but eWheels came through and delivered without any problems. The bonus fingerprint reader was factory installed and the added fast charger came separately a day before the scooter arrived. Anyway, I wanted to put at least 250 miles before I wrote this short review. I purchased the Thunder primarily for commuting purposes from Southern Brooklyn to Midtown Manhattan, NYC (~15 miles one way). When used on max settings, I use around 23% battery for the one way trip that consists of stop and go traffic, moderately high uphills  (especially on bridges) and straightaway path speeds up to 30 mph. Although this scooter can reach up to 50mph, I dare not to on public roads for the safety of others and myself. Even at 30mph, this is can be very dangerous. It also took me some time to get used to the throttle. It is very sensitive so I ended up using low power settings at first and made sure to enable kickstart mode. For the most part this is a solid, well built scooter with high quality parts. It has held up pretty good for my purpose. The only exception is the hinge part where the shaft folds down. This part started squeaking at around 150 miles and has minor play. I’m not sure if it specific to my scooter or with all but I find myself constantly adjusting and tightening bolts. According to the manual this part of the scooter should be replaced after one year or 3000 miles depending which comes first. Even with this issue, I would still recommend buying the Thunder.",

I did have to turn the acceleration down to make more snow friendly.  Once it warms up a bit I plan on using it to get to work daily and take it on hiking trails, I suppose I'll have to update my review once I've had a chance to play on it more but for what I've done on it so far The Dualtron Thunder has been amazing!",

The hydraulic brakes, cable insulation/management, 3 button display with an easy max power mode switch, stock road tubeless tires.\n\nI'm glad that I've ordered from eWheels since for the same price as other dealers you get a fast 5A charger with the feature to limit the max charge to 70-80-90% which will prolong your battery life. They also install a fingerprint scanner.\n\nI did have a couple of issues with the scooter, but eWheels support was great and solved the problems I had (either by sending the spare parts or by providing the detailed instructions to get it fixed by myself).\n\nIt's not a 100% polished model and it has a couple of minor problems: wires can be still damaged in some places, there is a play in the folding section that is impossible to fix and you will have to just ignore it, there is no stock light installed for the safe night riding.\n\nFor the headlight I'd recommend the Fenix BC35R (or the previous model).\n\nIt's really a great scooter, but you need to be prepared to fix some issues. If you are an engineer, just buy it already!",

          "content": "The best scooter out there. Period. Coming from a Dualtron 2 Ex, the Thunder feels like an entirely different scooter with a much more premium feel and look. But it comes at a hefty price, which is the only reason for me docking a star off its score. \n- The speed is amazing. You WILL beat cars off the line at green lights, but be sure to hold on tight because this much torque in the dual motors mode feels like a punch in the gut. \n- The range is impressive if you aren’t speed hungry and stay under 30mph. I can ride around in mild temperatures (50F) for around 3 hours before getting down to the last critical 15%\n- The wide tires allow you to ride with one hand which makes sending text messages at slow speeds doable without having to dismount. It also means you can adjust settings with one hand steering without it going squirrelly on you and tilting too much. Very premium. \n- The logo LED on the handle that lights up is viewable even in daylight and looks awesome. There’s also blue mood lighting that projects under the deck. I’ve gotten more “wows” from the Thunder (at night) then even from my electric unicycles. \n- THE HYDRAULIC BRAKES! OH my goodness. A major upgrade from the mechanical brakes of even my dualtron 2 with its dual disc brakes. The new braking system feels like a motorcycles brakes, smooth delivery with incredible stopping power. I can ride right up behind cars now without giving them too much following distance like I used to on thr dualtron 2, because I know the brakes can stop me on a dime. The new brakes alone are worth the $500 more from the Ultra. Supreme confidence and safety. I haven’t tried ABS braking yet so it can only get better. \n- Did I mention the speed? I hit 53mph on a straight (i’m 190 pounds with helmet/gear) easily enough speed to handle any city or town road. \n- The brake lights are a lot safer than any scooter I know. It flashes pops of yellow along with lighting up the typical red brakes, to grab drivers attention that you’re stopping. There’s even a hazard button that flashes strobes of yellow in the rear just like in a car!\n- The deck is very wide and comfortable for standing feet side by side. The new settings display is much easier to change things on. You’ll be happy to know that the ECO/TURBO button is gone (replaced with hazard lights) so you no longer have to worry about accidentally turning on eco mode instead of dual motors(happened a couple times on my dualtron 2, was wondering why I was going so slow when I saw eco mode had been pressed in.)",

It's the best tool for the job of downtown commuting.\n\nThe increased stability from the wider tire inspires you with confidence, and makes you feel like a better rider straight out of the box. The nikola foot plates that ewheels puts on are super comfy, and the perfect size for the average sized person (size 10 shoes here). Now this can tilt and turn in the width of the sidewalk without having to twist the wheel like a coin. No more pedal scraping with big sweeping turns. This is my favorite wheel of all that I've tried. The relatively larger battery and its overall smaller size add up to make quite a zippy little package that beats out the comparable in both performance and convenience. Just remember that you need to add some pads or some grip. If you're going to use the stock ones, I recommend putting the above your ankle and below your calves so you don't make the wheel any wider than it needs to be.",

It's not too heavy for stairs, and quiet enough to roll into a store without disturbing anyone. There's enough power to handle major hills, and small enough to take on a bus or subway. \nAfter a year on it, riding has become second nature. Farmland, pavement, and anything in-between is easy.

It has been really great for teaching my girlfriend on. She is now doing laps around the tennis court like a champ. We'll be riding trails together in no time! It has suffered a bit of cosmetic damage on the shell (scratches), but functions perfectly after several drops and crashes. This thing is definitely resilient.\n\nThe day after I received it, we got around a foot of snow here in Denver, but the MCM5 pushed through like a champ. I was a bit surprised with how well it handled the snow considering it's only a 14 inch wheel. There were definitely trouble spots such as the slushy parts of the road, but overall it did great. Better than my bike for sure! At first I was a bit bummed about the snow, but now I'm a bit thankful. I feel like it gave me a harder training mode for the final stages of learning and I definitely benefited from it.\n\nNow that the snow is gone, cruising around Denver is like a dream. I've been exploring all of the wonderful bike paths that there are around here. It's really fun when I find a spot from one of Chooch's videos and get to ride it myself. It has also made my commute to work infinitely better. Before hand, I was riding my mountain bike everywhere and it is definitely not geared for city riding. The MCM5 has been such a pleasure to ride, I've started taking a longer route to work to enjoy some of the bike trails that run through the nearby park. I even found a little skatepark on the longer route that is perfect for EUCs. I successfully dropped in the bowl today! Now I just need to add some pads on the side to help hop it out.\n\nI'm incredibly thankful that Photorph on the reddit sub recommended the MCM5 over the 14S. I would have outgrown the 18mph speed limit very quickly. I generally like to cruise at 18-20 on the MCM5, and riding those beeps would have definitely been a struggle.",

The thing that sets this purchase apart from almost every other, is the people behind the website. Jason is great. Period. I love a company who offers overnight service and actually ships right away. I hate paying for overnight when there is a 3-5 day or more “handling” period. Why couldn’t I wait? Well, I did wait. Five weeks to be exact, but NOT from Jason, from some Jacka$$ on that “magic carpet” site who never delivered. I just got tried of waiting for a delivery because I trusted a BS tracking number. The unit is GREAT and eWheels is AWESOME.. I wish I had come here in the first place. Thank you Jason for the lightening fast service. I will be able to crack my skull a few days earlier now! Sweet!",

Other wheels may have enough power, but the rough ride (and maybe some wobbles) prevent you from going top speeds on anything but perfect pavement. The big tire of the Monster evens out the bumps and provides stability so you can go fast basically all the time.",

Jason took care of my issue immediately and sent me a new set of shells no questions asked. Now about the wheel.. they certainly don't call it a monster for nothing. This wheel is a beast! I just can't get enough of it. It feels a close to riding in a car as you could possibly feel riding a unicycle. It's so smooth and fast. I regularly ride it around 40 mph and can do that for hours. When ordering the monster I opted for the larger Nikola pedals and it made such a difference. I don't regret a thing.",

          "content": "The Gotway Monster is absolutely unique. The sheer size and weight of it guarantees that the ride experience is unlike anything else you can experience on one wheel. It's a Cadillac. It's a Hummer. It's a Jaguar. It is smoooooooth. It can deal with bumps, holes, roots, and generally rough terrain without any issues at all.\n\nThe new control board and motor give it a power delivery that is hard to believe until you've experienced it. It feels like it has ENDLESS power, and shows it off best at speed. This wheel really comes into its own in the 20+ mph range, and the speed is deceiving! Everything about the wheel promotes a sense of languid ease, and the glide is so smooth that you won't realize how fast you're going until you check your phone or GPS! Even then though, the Monster makes it feel effortless and you can tell that it's always ready for more.\n\nThe handling is, again, unique. It is a chunky wheel, and there's no dressing that aspect up. You will have to take a wide stance with it and it will take several rides for your shins to get used to the high contact point. But once you do, this unwieldy-seeming beast will even its temper out a bit, and it becomes an absolute pleasure to ride. The stability is incredible, especially at speed, and even though it looks like it would be a challenge to turn, it's actually fairly nimble at low speeds once you learn to use your body weight in concert with it. \n\nThe acceleration is... different than any other wheel I've ever ridden. There is no doubt that the Monster has ample power. However, you do have to learn how to use it. The Monster has inertia and likes to stay at rest, so in order to change that you'll need put some effort in. Because the pedals are so stiff, you can stand on the forward edges of them on your tiptoes and the Monster will take off at a pretty good pace, but still more slowly than any other wheel. If you really want it to take off like the beast that you know is hidden within it, then you will have to clamp down on the sides of it with your legs and force it to tilt forward. When you do, it will take of like a bat out of hell, and you had better be ready for it! \n\nAll that said, I have not had a single second of buyer's remorse since the moment I clicked the purchase button. The Monster is a one-of-a-kind specimen in the EUC ecosystem, and one of the most joyful that I can imagine owning. It's big. It's fast. It's different. It's not for everybody. But if you're willing to learn about it, then you will have no regrets when you finally get it.",

          "content": "The Gotway Monster. \nI've waited some time before writing my review of the Gotway Monster.  And I must say, For me, it was worth every penny.  I've been riding this as my main source of transportation for over a year now.   It has been through a lot with me. I've ridden it in 6\"of snow for quite a while when I lived in Denver.  I used it to ride many trails that would be considered \"cross country\" style of riding on a mountain bike.  It was on a stock tire, and still is over 6 thousand miles later.  Since then I've enjoyed riding up and down even the steepest inclines with relative ease, including 58th street in denver and twin peaks in San Francisco.  It stays strong no matter where I'm going. And the seat is amazing.  It exactly what I had hoped for.  It honestly seems to be the closest thing to a one wheel motorcycle that's available.  I think of it as like riding a Harley, it's great for long distance cruising in a comfortable seated position. Although a little slower in take off (compared to a smaller wheel) ,It's very stable both seated and standing.  I'd say my average cruising speed is probably around 24 mph, and it's so stable that it doesn't feel \"sketchy\".  My daily ride lately has been around 30 miles.  And its so much faster to get around than any bicycle.  The larger diameter wheel and wide tire is so effective at absorbing all the bumps, even the ones you don't see.  It's defiantly a monster. But with the seat attached it becomes a convient height for walking beside while holding the seat.  And to me that's a fair trade off.  I prefer the seat over having a trolley handle, I think a seat gets more use.  It in my honest opinion, and review, again, the gotway monster was worth every penny.  If you can, purchase the larger battery, and  I would definitely purchase the fast charger.   The optional seat it a no brainer for longer commutes.  It's not a beginner wheel.  But, most people considering a monster have an electric unicycle already.  Own a monster.  You'll  thank me later.",

I did not want to write a review right away since I didn't even know how to ride it at first, so I waited about a couple of months to get some experience on it and I tell you this much, this wheel absolutely lived up to every expectation I ever had for it. I remember when I was going back home from a scooter shop one day with my e-scooter and I suddenly saw someone riding a one-wheel device go past me and I was just like \"What the hell is that\"? I had never seen anything like that. I immediately google searched what it could be by searching up \"one-wheel device\" and as it turns out, as I'm far too familiar with now, what I saw was an electric unicycle. I then saw Chooch from youtube do all this awesome riding with his own set of unicycles and I had never been convinced so fast in my life before - I decided to buy an electric unicycle. I thought about which model to buy and after watching videos from U-Stride, I decided to get a gotway msuper X 100v but as it wasn't available for me to buy at the time, I decided to get a 84v as I didn't want to wait to wait any longer. When I got it and started attempting to get on it, I thought I should have returned this because I just could not stay on for longer than 2 seconds, but then I thought to myself: \"I didn't spend almost two thousand dollars for nothing! I'm gonna keep trying, no matter what\"! And after 5 days of non-stop training, I was finally able to ride the thing. It became one of the best feelings of my life when I could finally ride it. Ever since, I have ridden countless miles with it, and even learned how to ride backwards with it. It has a crazy amount of mileage, and it is crazy fast too, at least compared to most uniycles that I know of. I am always outpseeding cyclists every time! I cannot emphasize enough how much I love this unicycle! I have used it at least 100 times now with hundreds of miles spent for commute to work, friends, family, etc. and it never fails to disappoint. Any EUC rider should get this unicycle, or the upgraded versions of this. It's one of the greatest inventions ever made for traveling, in my opinion.",

I watched a lot of YouTube videos of some prominent EUCers.   Know that my first choice was going to be the Ninebot Z10 (I think it's a sharp looking wheel) because of my perception of Segway making quality products.  What I found out was that was the Z10 has/had quality issues and that the Z10 is probably the last EUC Segway was making (guess they're focusing on escooters).  The last EUC bit is word of mouth, so take it with a grain of salt.  Then I looked at the King Song 18XL/16X as well as the Gotway MSX/Monster.  In the end, I chose the MSX as it was one of the ones that had the best reviews (eg people commented on the quality of the wheel).   \n\nMy personal take:\nI heard the angle of the foot pedals would be uncomfortable.  I didn't find the angle to be uncomfortable.  The angle helps press your legs against the body of the EUC which helps with stability.  What I am having to get accustomed to is when I ride for a while, my feet hurt.  That, though, is something I hear a lot of people talk about in general.  \n\nSo, am I happy with it?  Absolutely!  Solid wheel and rides extremely smoothly.  We'll see if I can learn to ride sitting down.\n\nOh, and my 13 yr son likes it, too.  Every time my son and I ride, he is all smiles...",

I first started thinking I wanted a \"One Wheel Skateboard,\" had it in my cart, and just couldn't click the purchase button.  The thing that was in the back of my head was how every video I had watched on YouTube said that a nose dive is a right of passage for the One Wheel.  This statement got me searching for something better for my style of riding.  That's when I stumbled upon electric unicycles!!  I was fascinated by the range, speed, and stability. There was no bold statements of nose dives, but that doesn't mean its not possible, just less likely hopefully.  The wrecks I had seen on electric unicycles people had majority been able to run it out or land on their knees.  I live in Wyoming so I knew I needed an electric unicycle that could also handle the trails.  That's were the the amazing Gotway MSuper X 1600Wh comes into my life.  With the 18x3 tire the ability to go from road to trail was possible.  So far there have been no problems with the MSX.  I have added padding to the front, top, and back because I am a total beginner as I said.  Starting off the first couple of days was tough, but I stuck it out and the rewards are worth the learning curve. Now I am able to vlog on my Youtube channel at Ryan's Content.

The steep pedal angle takes some getting used to (esp when mounting) but helps give me a way better posture and combined with being larger (and possibly not having a little rubber InMotion Logo on the edge) relieve a lot of the foot pain that I would get on even (what I then considered) medium length rides with the V8.  Same thing with the side/shin pads - they take some getting used to, but I love them.  The larger/wider tire and additional weight of the wheel make it effortless to just sort of toss the wheel between yours legs and carve back and forth.\n\nIf you're looking for your second wheel - I don't think you could go wrong with a 1600wh 84v MSX.  If you’ve gone on a 20 mile ride, returning home only because you were worried about the battery (possibly to charge it up and go back out) - do yourself a favor and just order now with the 12 month no interest financing and have paying for it be next-year-you’s problem, you won’t regret it.",

Especially love the distance, even with the lower watt hour configuration.  I commute for a minimum daily round trip of around 15 miles which the Gotway shrugs off like it was nothing.  Furthermore, having the extra speed in traffic is a HUGE confidence builder.  I also love the huge tire.  It feels incredibly stable, handles potholes and speedbumps like a champ, and even allows me to jump the curb or two that I used to have to walk the solowheel over.  Love this wheel.  Couldn't be any happier!  And E-Wheels is the ONLY place you should be looking.  Phenomenal outfit!",

I stay around the 15-20 mph range. Once I'm on I'm good to go. But I still need to work on mounting and dismointing. I am curious to see how it holds up in the rain. Time will tell.

I lacked enough respect originally, and it not so gently changed that. The wheel is beautiful. Absolutely powerful. Well built. Solid. When it says \"2000w\" it means it. I'm so glad I bought it, but it has taken patience to learn how to ride it. Probably I should have bought a 12\" or 10\" wheel to learn, but I wanted to buy one wheel and keep it forever. That's this one. No chance I grow out of it, it will go faster than I'd ever want to go. Only drawback is that it is so pretty that I cringe when it crashes. I don't want to scratch it up, but that's what learning is about. Highly recommended.",

Called Jason here at eWheels and after we spoke for a bit he actually recommended this wheel over the other two. It arrived fast and I immediately started working on learning how to ride it. This wheel is gorgeous. It is the \"black carbon fiber\" color and looks like a million bucks. Keep in mind, generally speaking, this is not a \"beginner wheel\" but I was able to ride down to the end of my street and back after about an hour of practice. The bluetooth actually worked well (I'd read some users had issues) and I have both the Gotway and a 3rd party app for it. The bluetooth speaker is just OK, but I didn't buy this wheel to play music. And as far as power/smoothness goes, this wheel is a beast.",

Finally pulled the trigger on my V10.  First Time rider and I did my homework before dropping $ on this venture.  For other first timers this is a great comfortable and strong wheel.  Being 230 lbs and 35 yrs old my anxiety toward my ability to ride was building.  With all the tutorial videos on youtube and tips from others, within a week I was mildy rolling without a wall next to me.  Within my 21 day goal, my body had learned the new skills to handle the wheel and everything clicked into place.  I love zipping around and weaving to the music.  Headlight is Super Bright, there is no reason a car wouldn't see you riding at night.  Speakers are nice and clear, Loud too!  Got 60 miles on her now and looking forward to every additional mile.\nDealing with EWheels was great.  Wheel was shipped out the afternoon I ordered it & From CA - VA I had the wheel Friday in time for the weekend.  I still have more to learn and build my skills, but this is the perfect wheel for me, no complaints here.",

I got the V10 with 650 Wh and it seems to be just enough for me. I love the big and wide tire, without being overkill. Very parctical wheel indeed. The range is enough for me, usually my feet get tired before the battery gets to 20% charge, although the pedals are big and comfy. Jason was really helpful and helped me find a cheaper alternative to ship the wheel to my country. I also got the rapid charger, which is a real gem as it not only preserves the battery (80%, 90%, 100% charge), but charges also at 1/3 of the time at 5 amps (also configurable). All in all, highly recommeded seller and wheel. Thanks Jason!",

The extra tire width strengthens its grip on the pavement, the over-engineered 2000w motor limited to 25mph gives me the confidence at higher speeds and in hard acceleration / stops I was looking for without fretting over a possible fried control board. I expected to dislike the external handle as a result of other reviewers referring to it feeling cheap, though I honestly don’t feel the telescoping handle feels much better... there’s an equal amount of play room in both versions, IMO. Extended battery life and improved LEDs are just icing on the cake. Looking forward to packing on some mileage!",

The range is nowhere near 62 miles.  I live in Seattle and weigh 200 lbs and plan to use 25 miles as my range estimate based on my research from other V10F owners until my experience teaches me that I can go further.     This includes not draining the battery below 20% because I know that is bad for the battery.   I rode my V10F up a 4 block long steep hill and it accelerated while going up with no problems.   If you are going to do long hill climbs with 3000  feet of vertical this wheel can struggle as I have seen in a couple YouTube videos but bear in mind that the v10F is being torchered in these videos and other wheels have their failures to.   I am confident that my V10f can climb the nasty hills we have around Seattle but that if I want to climb a mountain that there are better EUCs for that.\n\nThis wheel weighs 46 lbs.   When you pick it up, it's heavy.   The V10F was engineered with protections to help not fry the board.   With the 2000 watt motor it could easily go 30 to 35 mph.   I don't want to become one with the pavement at 35 mph and and am glad the wheel will save me from myself by limiting me to 25 mph.   A downside is that when I come off the wheel while learning to ride it skittered away before turning itself off.   This is something that other wheels are better at.   Other EUCs are know for better braking than the V10F,  I have found the brakes to be fine for me.   \n\nI love the big foot plates.   Some reviewers have talked about slipping off but I stick like glue.  Shifting my feet while riding is hard for me because I stick so well, even when my feet are wet.   Your mileage may very.   There is a grip tape conversion kit on eBay that (at this time) I do not plan to buy.    \n\nSafety:  \nWear elbow, wrist, knee guards and a helmet  ...  Hindsight is 20/20, better safe than sorry.",

          "content": "WoW! What an experience. 3 month later I love my new transportation to work. I am 6'2'' 240lbs at 43 years of age. This wheel as a new rider gets me 11 miles to work and 10 miles home with 9% battery left on one charge going 19-22mph to and 15-10mph from work. The V10F is very comfortable smooth and fun. i ride mostly on bike paths with some onroad asphalt, sidewalks as well as some off raod dirt/mud situations. I always want to go faster and hit the limiter(mild tiltback/audible beeps) as the wheel keeps me at a safer speed. If I push the wheel too hard with excessive acceleration or low battery/large power draw at once the wheel will do a slow tiltback with beeps or audible \"get off\" so I can exit the wheel, turn off the unit and restart again which is better than just a full power cut-off/faceplant. The headlight is bright at night and has a big coverage range. The speakers for music/calls/alert tones are loud and surprisingly have a full range of sound and volume. I have crashed mine 2 times at full speed as well as numerous slow maneuvers and the shell is extremely durable. The app to bluetooth to the wheel takes a few tries to connect but works perfecrtly with live readings, trip tracking as well as on the fly advanced adjustments like peddle angles, lighting featurs, horn, volumes, ride control etc. It took me alot of trial and error to learn all the manual controls, safety features and options this wheel has to offer.  3 months/500miles later with no problems and nothing but good times.",

The wider tire REALLY gives a smooth ride over what would otherwise be rough terrain for the 16S.  The larger rubber padded pedals make for an extremely comfortable ride, no more foot fatigue or pain, and their height means better clearance off-road and all but eliminates pedal scrape in urban areas.\n\nOf course, nothing comes without a price.  You do give up some of the incredible responsiveness and otherwise incredible nimbleness of the 16S.  Not too much, in my opinion... the V10F has decent acceleration and maneuverability, but there is no denying a measurable trade-off.\n\nThat said, right now, the V10F has the ride characteristics that I desire more.",

The V8/Glide 3 is not only more comfortable to ride both short and long distances, but it is also much easier to control.  The installation is pretty straight forward, however, since the 3D printed spacers did not come with the pedals, I did have to use nylon washers and with a little sanding to fit.  You can also use nylon spacers which are also available. Other than that these are the best investment you can make for both comfort and rideability.",

I have one complaint though: the paddings for calfs at the top of the wheel could be bigger and softer.  Padding for ankles does not exist. It hurts quite a bit and I got bruises on my calfs. I had to come with my own home solution for these paddings.  And I am reading that it is not only me, complaining. Even expert riders add their own padding for comfort and stability.  This is the reason why I give the wheel 4 stars.",

          "content": "This is my first euc! Loving it, came from Meepo V3 ER. KS14D seems to be getting about the same range as my e-board; 20 miles, although at almost half the speed. The tilt sensor isn't timid about tilting you backwards once you pass 18mph. It only took me about an hour to learn basics how to ride with youtube videos, now 2 days later i feel alot more confident in my ability, can almost drain the battery in one ride, ride through grass and dirt, up and down small curbs. What's stopping me is soreness from the muscles I've been building while riding. It's takes alot of balance and most of your weight ends of leaning on your shins pressed against the wheel. Im still getting used to that with bruised shins, i should take a day or 2 break and let them heal but it's soo much fun I can't stop haha my only complaint is the King Song App. EWheels sent me an email about a different app that actually worked better. But it still lacked key info from real app. So sometimes i need to switch between apps, can be a pain. App is required to unlock the wheel when it first arrives, but after that you never need to use the app again.",

I'm 35lbs over recommended weight and it did not hinder the functioning of this lil machine at all, the extra weight does drain the battery quicker. Sorry I can't say what I got in range on single charge because I upgraded quickly because I knew I was sticking with riding EUC so I needed range. I have crashed it several times and besides some scratches it continues to work totally fine. The trolley handle works really well, it will work better for someone shorter but I have long arms so it worked for me, BTW, KingSong has best trolley handle designs. I got the 14D up to 18 mph with no problem, keep in mind I'm over the weight limit, so again impressive! \n  I can tell that KingSong really puts time/effort into it making a product that will make the whole experience of owning and riding a EUC safe, functional and enjoyable! \nI wish I had more input to give regarding extended durability if this KingSong 14D but I only put lil over hundred miles on it before I was upgrading. But again this lil wheel impressed me, it has taken me up steep inclines, light off roading and it's handle it like A TANK! \nIf money is tight and you're not sure this type of experience will be something you will stick with, get this because you still be be getting a quality machine, that won't break the bank. The speakers are fair, I liked the lights more than I thought I would but with that said, personally I can do without lights and speakers.\n   I know myself will enough to know that just by watching YouTube videos that I was going to love having a EUC so I wish I had skipped this wheel and purchased a wheel that I had plenty of room to grow into. I have a Gotway MSP now and I wish it had been my first wheel. Because of health issues the EUC replaced my bicycle, so it's given me back my freedom to get back outside, have fun and see the world, one trail at a time! Riding a EUC is such a freeing sensation!! I have to admit though, I honestly viewed EUC's as toys before I rode one but I quickly realized these EUCs are built tough, so now I consider them as legit personal transportation vehicles.\n\nMy experience with Ewheels: I'm old school in the since that I value professionalism, I believe in doing what you say and if you mess up, admit it and do all you can to make things right, these are values that are almost extinct now days!!! Except for this company, I'm TOTALLY pleased with my dealings with them! Ewheels values their customers and they strive to make their customers completely satisfied!!!! I've purchased 4 wheels from them and you should buy your wheel from them also!",

Now don't drive my car all weekend long, I just take my wheel all over town.  A quick trip downtown is a breeze, even during heavy summer traffic.  It has more power than I expected, and has no trouble taking me(170 lbs.) up steep hills.\nIt is also very maneuverable.  I have no trouble avoiding defects on the road or on trails in the woods.",

It kept tilting back for no apparent reason and therefore was very hard to ride.\n\nThe King Song 14D is a fine wheel.  It's a little more nimble than my InMotion V8, because the 14D has a smaller wheel, but I think that nimbleness which might make it better on busy sidewalks, makes it a bit harder to learn to ride than the V8.\n\nThe King Song Motor cutoff switch (stops wheel from spinning when you pick it up) senses that you're lifting the weight of the wheel from the handle (which is also the trolley handle.)  It's automatic.  This model also has headlights on both ends and Bluetooth speakers and a USB port for charging your phone etc. - Nice extras.",

As far as I can tell, it's just a baby version of the 18XL or 16S.\n\nAnd it can really take a beating! I must've dumped it 30 times so far, and other than some scratches on the glossy finish, no harm done that I can tell.\n\nThe only negative I can come up with is the pads. Really hard on the inside of my calves. I think that's an issue of technique and muscle buildup I'll overcome in a couple weeks. But that's why I deducted 1 point. I think a pad (even some sort of extension like a seat?) that hit closer to the knees instead of mid-shin would solve that.\n\nBecause of the size and performance limits, I think it'll be a great wheel for my son when I do eventually move on to something bigger/faster/longer-range.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the wheel to anyone new to EUCs would wanted something fun to try out. And if you don't plan to commute with it, or are in a lower-speed dense urban area with bike lanes for the most part, I think you could probably live with it happily as your only wheel for a very long time.",

My handle started jamming while putting in the down position because of that.  \n\nMake sure the tires are always fully inflated.  I had a couple flat tires due to slightly deflated tires getting pinched and it's a project to replace the inner-tube.  \n\nMy first wheel was either outright stolen or the person who came upon it when I accidentally left it unattended for longer than I should have didn't know who to call so I recommend sticking a label with your contact info on it.  \n\nHappy wheeling!",

          "content": "First wheel purchase\nReason for purchase - Commute to work, I live in San Francisco and the hills are just as annoying going up and down\n\nWhy did I choose a eWheel - I considered all sorts of electric vehicles, these eWheels are the most versatile, you can go on the street or on the sidewalk, they are also very small so it's easy to maneuver around people or bring into a restaurant and put under your chair.\n\nHow long did it take to learn to ride - about an hour trying to balance in my house, 1 or two more hours outside practicing before I felt comfortable riding to work.\n\nDurability -  During the practice phase I lost control a couple times going decently fast and jumped off the wheel took a nice tumble but it's shown zero signs of slowing down\n\nSpeed - I was considering a slightly slower wheel and I'm happy I chose this one, once you get used to it the speed is nice, especially if you need to tackle hills\n\nFavorite feature - Effortlessly going up hills, I have friends who have electric skateboards and their boards aren't able to get them up the same hills I cruise over. The lights on the front and back are nice safety features for night time\n\nQuirks - The apps are really janky and you need to download them to unlock the speed\n\nSuggestions to manufacturer for improvement - the telescoping handle could go a little higher, I'm not that tall so it's manageable but if I were any taller i would have to be very hunched over to use it. \nThe speed is controlled electronically and if you are exceeding the max speed it will beep and pull you back a little bit, this is fine on flat ground but when the battery is running low and you are going up hill it thinks you are going max speed when you are not going very fast. I think the speed is measured by measuring some variable of energy usage rather than calculating rotational speed\n\nOverall I love this device, all my friends thought I was a weirdo for buying one, but they are slowly coming around to understanding this is the future of transportation!",

          "content": "A few months ago when I got really excited about getting an EUC, I spent several weeks researching the options and decided this was the one for me. My wife wasn't convinced (she thought it was a pricey toy I'd lose interest in after a day). So I waited, not at all patiently, and by that time it was Christmas and since I'd spent the intervening time making her watch videos and reviews she surprised me with one!\nIt arrived and she still was not impressed. I took it out and went through the necessary 15-30 minutes of just trying to roll the the thing a few feet before it clicked. For about a month she showed no interest in it until she happened to see me gliding (i ride it to work everyday) and she agreed to give it a try. She can be a bit uncoordinated, so she hasn't taken to it as quickly as I have, but she's stubborn. The point is, anyone can learn to ride this thing and just standing on it is enough to make you a believer. She told me to get her one for her birthday. Can't wait for our first riding date.\nSome things you should know:\nIt's awesome and I love it. I can attest to what has been said about slower models, I wanted to max this thing out as soon as it would let me (5km traveled). I have very little desire to go faster, especially after my crash at top speed, more on that later.\nIt is sturdy. I fell off the front at 18 mph, skidded several feet across the road, and thanks to my liberal application of padding, there was barely a scratch on the unicycle. Me not so much, but I was lucky. Wear pads.\nIt's going to take a few days to get proficient. After the first training session, I was very sore. Muscles I don't use very much got a real work out and until you can balance and shift your weight proficiently you're going to bang up your legs.\nHeed the tilt back warning. The only crash I've had was a bad one and it was all because I was stupid. Once I hit the top speed I tried leaning even harder into it to see how fast I could go. Once you reach top speed, that is it. If you lean more, it's not going to speed up, which means no more torque, which means there's nothing to keep you upright. Painful lesson but I did it for you guys and gals. The good news is that it took concerted effort and stupidity to lean over the tilt back so you can't do it accidentally.\nWhen joy riding I very rarely reach half battery capacity, the point where you begin to slow down. I'm usually a bit tired and cold by then and happy to wind down, but if 30-45 minutes isn't a long enough ride for you, consider the 14S.",

I weigh 190 lbs and I found it was responsive, smooth and nimble.  My daughter weighs 90 lbs and the wheel performs flawlessly for her, with great range and handling.  She can pick it up easily on her own (it weighs 27.5 lbs) and it's much more compact than I thought it would be.  This is a great wheel for a first time rider (child or adult).

It is relatively large as EUC’s go and fairly heavy as well at a bit over 50 lbs, so it took some time to learn how to control it.  I watched several tutorial videos on YouTube and after about 2 hours of trial and error, something suddenly “clicked” in my brain and I was able to ride figure eights with little effort! Over the next two days I logged 25 miles over a combination of gravel, paved roads and even some grass, and the 18XL handled all with ease. An incredibly rewarding and thrilling experience. I read several reviews that suggested beginners should start with something smaller and easier to control, but don’t let that influence you. I’m proof that a newbie can learn to ride on these advanced wheels. \n\nI’d also highly recommend purchasing the protective neoprene cover, especially if you’re new to EUC’s.

The KS 18XL takes a bit more effort to turn than the smaller V8, but it is still very agile despite being a much larger wheel. However, you will feel the extra weight when lifting it off the ground. If you're a smaller rider or looking for a last mile commuting solution, then you should probably check out some slimmer and lighter EUCs that will be easier to lift and transport. This wheel was designed with long range cruising in mind. I went with the KS 18XL over flagship models from other manufacturers due to it having the best combination of power and practicality. This thing can go anywhere, whether you're riding or walking. I have yet to find a hill it can't climb and King Song's best in class trolley handle allows you to walk around with minimal effort when you'd rather be on your feet. When you also factor in unique features like the large peddles, lift sensor, mudflap, brake light, quiet motor, and more speed than you'll probably ever need, you've got one of the best wheels in the game.",

          "content": "100 miles in the first 3 days - after getting into this about two weeks ago?  Three of the best days of my life!  I was lucky enough to get a really good deal on a ninebot one e+ a couple weeks ago.  Took 10 hours across three days to find my balance, but then I started to explore.  Just an exhilarating experience once I got going - and understanding how much there is to learn and grow with this experience.  And it's contemporary.  And it's cool.\n\nI settled on the Kingsong 18XL as the best all around wheel for someone like myself, looking for the ultimate upgrade from the e+.  It is exactly what I wanted - torque, range, speed.  I've still only hit 26 MPH, and that felt super fast.  I'm guessing as I gain experience, I will also gain comfort.\n\nI've really put the unit through it's paces in the last few days - one super nice day, once out in the rain, and today out in the puddles and mud.  Really hoping it can take this abuse over the long haul - be interesting to find out.\n\nI'd say in my novice ability that this wheel really likes smooth surfaces - it just glides, and takes corners really well - also learning to carve long S turns, which this unit (all wheels?) really seems made for.  It's torque is super impressive going up hills, I've never felt like it didn't have enough power, just my lack of ability, or loose ground has stopped some ascents.  It manages offroad really well, but I think I might have the tire pressure a bit high (right around 40) which bounced me around on the more uneven surfaces.  Sure that offroad is a lot of technique/experience too.  Really like the foot pedals - big and grippy.  My feet were getting ruined by the ninebot e+, and in the last three days of riding, my feet have actually improved on the 18XL, so that is a good sign.\n\nSo I'm all in on this unit, and can't wait to keep improving my skill - always remember - Safety First!",

I recommend this wheel to anybody upgrading from a smaller wheel or just getting into EUC's. Jason is very helpful and quick to reply to questions or issues if they come up. Very happy with both of these wheels. Cheers!",

          "content": "I purchased this a few months back and purposely waited 250km to write a review.  My first wheel was an Mten3.  At 190lbs, I destroyed that first wheel in 11 months, but saw the benefits of having ultra portable transportation.  In Michigan, our roads are bumpy where they get patched - almost like cobblestones in spots.  For that reason, I wanted a large wheel that would takes those bumps without throwing the rider off.  I use the wheel for last 10 miles transportation and some longer hauls that are more recreational and some shorter trips that are 2 to 4 miles.  It came down to the MSX and the 18XL as the finalists.  Having been on the Mten3, I wanted something that had a bigger footprint, but could still be lifted up (53lbs) by a reasonable strength male.  The primary differentiators that made me select the XL are the trolley handle, foot petals, narrower width, removable side panels, bluetooth, reportedly lower cost of replacement parts.\n\nThat trolley handle is amazing - I ran out of battery about 4 miles from my destination this week and walked the machine the rest of the way without issue.  The XL trolley handle actually has two heights - halfway up it can lock at about 3' off the ground or can go up another foot to about 4'.\n\nNext - the foot petals are rounded.  That makes the nearly impossible to ground out even on tight turns.  They are incredibly grippy and comfortable even on a multi-hour ride.\n\nThe narrower width was actually something I thought was going to be a regretable decision.  The MSX has that wide tire that looked more attractive and robust.  The XL's tire is a beast though.  2.5\" wide.  The machine feels super comfortable while riding.\n\nWith the XL, I got the body-glove rubberized cover.  If you purchase and XL, get this.  it saved me when I fumbled a bit in the beginning at stoplights and ended up laying the machine on its side as I lost balance.  Looks very good and the side mood lighting comes through the pre-cut holes.\n\nThe bluetooth was a selling feature.  I use it for Google maps and it takes me right from point A to B.  The sound is plenty good and very loud if the rider wants it to be.\n\nFinally, I am embarrassingly incompetent with mechanical repairs.  Like I will never be able to change the tire bad.  For that reason, I wanted a machine that was friendly for Ewheels to provide service on.  The XL seems to come apart and go back together relatively easily for a mechanic who does this every day.  We will find out in time if I was correct.\n\nThe negatives are nitpicky\n1) the Kingsong application is buggy and continually crashes, but is still more feature-rich than what I had with the Gotway before I killed that EUC last August.\n\n2) the speed throttling I was not looking forward to.  It kept me to 40km/hr for the first 200km of distance.  Unlike my dead Mten3, the XL doesn't beep - it says \"PLEASE DECELERATE\" so loud that it is embarrassing.  That turned out to be a good thing though and kept me to modest speeds until I learned the wheel.  I guarantee you that 31MPH top end speed is plenty sufficient for almost every rider.  I rarely hit that top number even on open smooth roads.\n\n3) braking is \"meh\" - the 18\" wheels are cruisers.  The XL is plenty fast off the line and has more than enough beef to get up a steep gradient.  In the few instances where I had to come to a quick stop, the heavy back lean caused the wheel to wobble as I slowed quickly.  This is more a function of having an 18\" wheel vs a performance defect.\n\nLast note - if I could give this 6 stars I would.  Anyone who is considering a wheel would be well served to think of the Kingsong 18XL.",

          "content": "I bought the KS18XL in July 2019 as my first EUC. I am 72 years old and it took me a couple of weeks just to go a few feet. Once my brain, my body, and the EUC connected with each other there was no turning back. I have over 1,600 miles on it now. I think it is no exaggeration to say it has bounced and skidded across pavement and grass at least a hundred times and in spite of that it has never faltered once. There is so much to learn if this is a first experience. I fell only once when I first got the wheel when I was learning how to turn. Once I learned how to mount and ride, I never even think about falling although I've had the wheel go out from under me when on rough gravel roads. My favorite speed is about 15-18 MPH. I have ridden at 27 MPH but just don't enjoy that. I have found no other EUC riders in Oklahoma City so I ride alone with my favorite music on the EUC bluetooth. I have a 4 pound dog that I carry with me when I am riding slow. I have been a lifetime bicyclist and I have to say this is one of the most fun things an old man can have. It is like riding on a magic carpet. It is a heavy wheel, at 53 pounds, but I think that is why it feels so stable, especially if you hit imperfections in the road. I think everyone should own an electric unicycle. I think my 18XL is a first generation. It does have a very unobtrusive whine to it when riding up hills or pushing it harder. It seems the new ones are supposed to quieter. I have ridden it at night and when on level ground the light illuminates the path just fine but when I am going up hills the light points more downward. Since I don't push my 18XL to the limits it is easy to go 70 miles on a charge even with the modest hilly terrain. The most I have ridden on a single trip is 30 miles so you just shouldn't have any range anxiety. I do wish I had bought the larger/faster charger when I bought the wheel because Ewheels discounts it a lot if you buy it at the time of your wheel purchase.",

A lighter wheel might have made the initial learning process a bit easier (less strenuous), but once I was able to actually balance and stay on those problems went away. The wheel has plenty of power and the top speed is sufficient for keeping up with traffic on my neighborhood roads. In the city, it does really well going over the cracks and bumps in the pavement. I've heard King Song motors can be noisy. And while there is a bit of a whine, it isn't annoying at all, and again I have nothing to compare it to. I've even had cyclists on trails comment on how quiet it is.\nI've got over 500 miles on the wheel so far and my only real issue has been with the pressure switch on the trolley handle. I don't know if it's because I dropped it so many times learning, but sometimes it just refuses to work. Not a big deal, as I can always reach down and shut off the wheel. But the wheel spinning up and the decelerate alarm can be a bit embarrassing when I pick it up to go up some stairs to enter a restaurant or other establishment.\nI also purchased a fast charger and a roll.nz protective cover from Jason. Both have been working great!",

Maybe a smaller when would have more torque, but I need an even larger wheel for better roll over... I've ridden lots of Rocky two track and single track and it's taken several nasty tumbles but keeps on ticking.  Speakers are fun, a bit lacking in bass. The Android app does work pretty well, but crashes a lot.  The handle is awesome, the xl pedals are really nice, maybe even a bit too wide now that I keep my ankles in closer to the wheel.  Motor has a nice whine to it, not silent but not loud at all. Motor sounds a bit ratchety at very low, high torque moments but I think that's normal.  80 mi range seems accurate, this thing goes forever! I wish it had a battery guage on top, and an option for a seat. Seems like there's also room for improvement on control algorithm for steep and long ascents and descents, i find myself recalibrating the horizontal to keep from having to lean so far forward to get it to go uphill faster without the pedals getting too low.  It did get quite hot on a long climb of around 3000', but I was pushing it hard and it gave me an over power warning, so I hopped off, cooled the aluminum rim with snow and it descended just fine after that.  It does have an ever so slight wobble/runout that is more audible than palpable at high speeds which makes me wonder if the rim is a bit out of true as I've heard some euc's can be, but I haven't checked.

To upgrade to an advanced wheel has finally untethered me to explore for hours at a time that I could not do with a limited battery. The difference in distance with the 18XL is nothing short of amazing. I weigh 180lbs, and I can travel up steep hills for miles. Within 24 hours of owning the wheel, however, I leaned into a hill too far and triggered the circuit breaker and bit the chew pretty bad going 25mph. I had wrist guards and helmet, but said \"I don't need knee pads for where I'm going.\" Big mistake! If you are new to advanced wheels and are unfamiliar with faster speeds, be careful and don't get cocky! My wheel was scuffed pretty good and the rubber mud guard was completely destroyed, and I had to buy a new one. The wheel still works perfectly after my tumble. Its fast, and I cant stress enough the distance you can travel without eating up the battery on this wheel. I recommend a fast charger, the battery bank is so large it can take well over 12 hours to charge a battery of about 40% on the standard charger. The headlight at night is very bright, and a supplemental flashlight is not needed in many instances. I didn't like the strobe mode at first, but now seeing how much other drivers notice me with the strobe on, I feel significantly safer that cars can see me (you can use the app to change headlight to On, OFF, and STROBE).  The trolley handle works really well, and is not too high like I thought it would be from pictures. The pick up sensor has worked flawlessly for me, I've read others have had issues with it but I've had no problems. The speakers are good enough, it's funny to hear Google Maps announce directions from the wheel when I'm cruising around town (\"In 1000 feet, turn left.\"). The entire machine is of the highest quality materials and build strength. Nothing about it seems cheap. If you are looking for an upgraded wheel that can go the distance, this wheel is for you!",

          "content": "I commute 6.5km each way on an EUC and frequently take longer rides (as battery allows)... My previous EUC was a SoloWheel Glide3 (aka InMotion V8). It was a great starter wheel, but this, the KS18XL, is an awesome upgrade! It's larger and heavier, but also much more stable, smooth and fast! Because of its stability, it's easy to ride.\nAs I ride in bike lanes and on multi-use paths, I previously rode, most of the time, at the V8's limit (28-30 kph) and thus almost constantly with some pedal tiltback (ie, sore feet) and with precious little buffer before the speed alarm. Conversely, with the KS18XL, I ride very comfortably in the same lanes/paths at 30-35 kph with tons of buffer before the speed alarm (which I have currently set to 40 kph -- where the wheel's max is 50 I think). Also with the KS18XL I no longer hold up bikes that are following me down hills. So I am more comfortable, ride better, and feel safer.\nDownsides? I heard the pedals were stiff but on mine they have a definite down and up setting and are fine. The BT speaker isn't great for music, but it's nice and loud for the speed warning. The app is OK but I would like control of the voices (\"bleu tooth is off\"!?!?). The BT connection to my phone often drops (while the phone is my pocket) so not all my rides are fully instrumented/ recorded. I love the colour LEDs, the headlight and the brake light! The handle seems fine. I found that the motor disconnect sensor works best if the wheel is at a full stop. I can't tell you how it crashes (although other owners say it's very tough)... I've only had it a week and only have 200 km on it. Oh, and I love the long range. It means I don't have to charge it every day, and I can go on a 20 km ride even if I only have 50% charge.\nI short, I love it. I recommend getting a smaller/cheaper wheel to learn on, but if you need a commuting wheel (or don't need something ultra agile), the KS18XL is awesome!",

          "content": "I took delivery of my KingSong 18XL six weeks ago. In that time I have put over 130 miles on the wheel and it has met or exceeded all of my expectations.\n\nWhen I received the KingSong 18XL, I was still learning to ride on a KingSong 14D. Being a taller and heavier rider with larger feet, I found an immediate difference in comfort and stability riding the 18XL.\n\nEventually I became a competent enough rider to really put the 18XL through some tests. I’ve taken it on smooth pavement, rough pavement, off-road, up hills, and down hills. Through all of my riding the 18XL has easily handled anything I’ve thrown at it. Additionally the bigger 18 inch wheel along with the XL size pedals provides a very smooth and stable ride. \n\nOne of my first impressions after unboxing the 18XL was that this is a very solid wheel with top-notch build quality. In my time with the wheel so far, I’ve had a few mishaps requiring me to bail and jump off the wheel. The wheel has proven to be quite durable and has only suffered a few very minor scuffs as a result.\n\nThe 18XL also has some very nice amenities that I’ve been enjoying. The Bluetooth speakers are powerful enough to allow the rider and friends riding nearby to enjoy music. The quality of the sound is not the greatest but it is completely adequate for this application. The headlight is extremely bright and provides ample illumination to see the road in dark conditions. Some have said that the angle of the headlight is not optimal, but I have not personally had this issue. Lastly the trolley handle is strong and deploys to a very good height. The handle also features a lift sensor to temporarily disable the wheel’s balancing when it is lifted off of the ground. I’ve seen posts online that say the lift sensor can be unreliable but it has worked every time for me. This trolley design makes moving the wheel around simple and easy. \n\nThe only two downsides I can think of for this wheel are the weight of it and the quality of the smartphone application. This wheel weighs over 50 pounds. For some this might be too heavy or unwieldy, but for me I find the weight to be almost unnoticeable when riding and just a minor annoyance if I am lifting the wheel off the ground. The smartphone application does perform the necessary features but it is not well made and it also requires you to register with KingSong to perform some operations on the wheel. Unfortunately, I understand this is a pretty common complaint across most electric unicycle manufacturers and applications, so I can’t really hold it against the 18XL specifically. \n\nOverall, I am extremely pleased with my purchase of the 18XL. This wheel has more power, speed, and range than I will probably ever need with an awesome riding experience.",

The wheel itself is everything I was hoping it to be: fast, reliable and tons of fun but it's not perfect: it's heavy and the trolley to carry/roll it is a bit flimsy and since I use it a lot on my commute, it got broken eventually and that's where things can get complicated, needing replacement parts from a brand that is not widely distributed in the US but eWheels stepped up to the plate and shipped the new improved KS18XL trolley sliders in a couple days and even provided video instructions: this is awesome customer service and that's why I keep coming back as a happy ewheeler!",

However, the transition was really easy, and I now love the 18XL. The only issue I’ve had is that the handle lift-sensor doesn’t always work the first time (listen for the beeps), but that’s a minor issue and doesn’t take away anything from the overall great experience. The 18XL is super smooth, climbs steep hills with ease, and is very comfortable to ride. Even tight turns in small spaces have been no problem at all — it’s highly maneuverable. Even the speakers sound good. I like to use them when I’m not riding around other people. But, if there are people around, it’s more fun to listen for comments like, “Whoa! What was that!?”.",

          "content": "Brilliant scooter - got it because I scrapped my car recently and thought about just how much that 500 USD car ended up costing me in the two years I managed to keep it running. This is, by far, the more economical option.\n\nGreat construction, compared against a 250 USD Gotrax \"Rival\" I tried out to be sure I'd like a scooter vs. walking -- the first thing I noticed was that this uses proper metals for the dang screws, which is not a given in most product markets so yay for details. But the whole thing is quite sturdy construction, bolts where one would want bolts, etc. If I had to guess at a weak spot it'd be the stem clamp screws (added some loctite to fix the wobble after a couple days) and possibly the bolt that holds the stem to the body, not the one that locks the fold but the fixed one, so keep an eye on that one would be my bet. Speaking of the bolt that locks the body into folded and unfolded, that thing is solid and so much better than lever methods, for my money. \n\nI weigh right at 20 stone (280 lbs or so) and this thing doesn't even notice me. The fact the suspension holds up means it's probably pretty firm for a lighter rider. The \"gears\" for speed give you some \"out of the box\" flexibility, especially because they behave differently with eco mode or turbo mode selected, and slightly differently with single or dual motor selected. 2 in eco mode, single motor caps around 15mph or so, so that's a good place to practice riding. I feel really unsafe going over 20mph as of yet, so after some fiddling I found that setting the power % limiter (option P7 on the throttle, I think) to 65% I can put it in turbo, dual motor, and cap out at 18mph, while not losing speed on the grade coming home, and more traction in general. Also I vaguely worry about running in single-motor mode permanently, that might be entirely unfounded tho. \n\nCommute effect: 30-45 minutes (basically 30 to work and 45 coming home for obvious reasons) is now about 10 each way, 15 actual trip time (from backroom of store to my front door). So I can be making dinner by 7:20-30 AM rather than 8 or 8:15. Also set my wake-up alarm 15 minutes later. Real world effect is disproportionate to actual trip-time saved, and very worth it, especially on those days I just really don't want to walk home. On the negative side: Rain is a bigger problem vs walking -- it's (relatively) safe to ride in some rain, albeit slowly, but I wear glasses so riding while it is *currently* raining isn't an option, can't see a thing. Umbrellas aren't an option for obvious reasons.\n\nSturdiness: I'd dropped it several times, hit a bump and just end up ditching it and so forth, and also once hit a patch of mud, skidded into grass, the wheel just got stuck and flipped me and the thing over. I had some cleaning to do, to get mud out of the brake handle, brakes, off the throttle, etc., but the only harm it did was to the \"speedway\" logo light on the right side, which also works again now because it was just water got in the lens, not a crack in the filter. There's not a mark on the thing after  a fair bit of flinging it around, learning to ride. So that's a good sign. \n\nBasically, the only complain I can think of is the brake disc makes noise because bits of dirt/sand get in it, which you can wipe off and they just get back in as soon as you ride it. I thought they were just too tight at first, I was wrong, and also had trouble getting them tight again, so try wiping the disc off before you loosen the brakes if its just an odd noise yer after.\n\nOnce, I started it and there was rather strong vibration, rattling the whole stem. Still not sure what that was, was around the front motor, the speed capped at 10mph on the speedometer and it felt like a \"let go\" when it went back to normal maybe 30 seconds later. If I had to guess, it was the electric brake - I turned that off for a ride and then back on and it hasn't happened since, but it may have been something else entirely, dunno.\n\nFor completion's sake, the fingerprint scanner was missing a screw that goes thru the two circles and holds it to the handlebars. I just used a machine screw I had lying around which fit. It's a small oversight and I've done plenty similar at my own job :P. \n\nSo yeah, really nothing to complain about here, get's me to points a and b without much fuss, only have to charge once a week, and that'll take no time at all when the fast charger gets here - as well as, unless I'm misunderstanding how kw hours are measured, it costs like 20-25c to charge this thing, vs. like 10+ a week in gas for a car even with the currently worryingly low price per gallon in the US. Moreover, it's enough I *could* go into town, take maybe half an hour at 20mph to hit the city limits, so maybe a 2 hour travel time for a trip to town, counting moving to the square and one or two other locations? Not bad. \n\nHere's the absolute best perspective I can put on it tho. This was 3.5 paychecks, for me, and I'm not disappointed. Whether yer looking for a commute vehicle and the cost is dear to you, or a toy for the weekend and it's not, thing's worth the cost.",

          "content": "I previously had an Emove Cruiser which is related to the Speedway V in design except that the Speedway 5 has dual motors, better suspension and is overall better in quality.  I especially like the folding mechanism and the fact that it won't tip over when folded.  Often I take the ferry and park the scooter under the stairway on the boat.  Since the boat can rock back and forth it's much better to fold the scooter so it won't tip over and scratch or damage the handlebar or other parts.\n\nThis is a heavy duty scooter.  Since I now live on the ground floor, it's not a big deal that the scooter is so heavy.  \n\nGiven the excellent acceleration, I feel comfortable when having to drive with traffic in Brooklyn.  Of course I would never get on the highway but it's great for surface streets when you have to keep up with traffic.  Generally I ride on the bike lanes but occasionally have to switch to the road.\n\nI added a bar-end mirror on my left side handlebar so I can see if traffic is behind me... Unfortunately, I had to cut a hole in the handlebar end to accommodate the mirror but there isn't much room due to the cylinder spring that allows the handlebars to fold.\n\nI loved the deal with the fast charger and finger print scanner.  I was thinking of purchasing from a different dealer but these two extras along with the warranty sealed the deal with eWheels.\n\nLooking forward to the warmer months as I simply gave it a test drive here in February in NYC.  Even though we are having a mild winter, I prefer to ride in a bit warmer weather.",

          "content": "The Speedway 5 is a heavy, powerful, long range, hill crushing, street scooter. It's a legitimate commuting machine if you need to commute over moderately long distances, and/or over significant hills. \nI'm 185lbs and live in a very hilly area. The road to my house has a steep half mile ascent that would make any single motor scooter give up and die. The Speedway 5 cruises up the hillside at 20-25mph no problem. \nOn flat ground I've managed to hit a top speed of 34mph before I chickened out (*I was wearing a full face helmet, motorcycle jacket w/ ce rated padding, jeans, knee pads, and high tops.), and range is extremely impressive. The longest ride I've taken is 20 miles, and I used approx. 50% battery with steep hills included. I think I can get a solid 35 miles, real world around my house, and at least 5 miles more if I just rode on flat ground. \n\nOne thing to note, out of the box you will want to give it a through once over, and apply loctite to the screws around the handlebar & stem, adjust the handlebar accessories to your liking, check the tires, etc. \n\nLastly, eWheels.com has great service, and the entire process was smooth and pain free. Thank you.",

          "content": "After doing my research, I went with the SpeedWay V vs a Dualtron. Size and weight was a major point. I drive a Fiat 500e and I needed to be able to pull the eScooter in and out of the small space I have to work with. \n\nWas afraid the SpeedWay V was going to be underpowered compare to the Dualtron and thought maybe should have gotten the Dualtron after playing the order. But the SpeedWay V performance is amazing! Even with just having one wheel enabled, no turbo and all other settings set to default its fast enough. I’m about 150-160 lbs and was able to get up to 19mph. Enabling dual wheels was able to get up to 22-23mph and was pretty fast. Enabling Turbo made it even faster and didn’t really attempt to see how fast it would go I chickened out. This eScooter is quick and has plenty of torque. The suspension felt great. Brakes, I think the Rear could be stronger. The front brakes grips harder, I might need to adjust the rear. \n\nOut of the box, there is some assembly. The Brake handles and controls need to be adjusted to rider preference. Bolts should be check to made sure tight. I had bolts in the stem that was loose. Headlight needs to be installed. \n\nThe pin the locks the stem of the Scooter was really tight. The user manual doesn’t say how far the Pin needs to go into the hole, but figured out it needs to fully go all the way in till It stops. After some use it should get easier. \n\nNo mention of charge out of the box… The Scooter came with about 50% charge. I test drove it around for a bit and then charged it with the 5A Fast Charger Which I set it to 80% and 5A. Took about 2 hours. When powered up to verify Scooter showed 90%. I rode it day after about 5 miles with only 1 wheel enabled. I was down to 88%. ReGen still on default setting worked great. \n\nThe Right controls kept the sleeve that locks the handle bar from fully pulling out to fold down and would rub. Left side was fine. \n\nThe Handle Bar enter being square stock limits what you can mount to the handle bar. Since most items like headlights and phone holder mount to round tube bars. So aftermarket handle bar extenders need to be sourced to mount additional lights or items.\n\nThe headlight that comes with the scooter is Okay. I added additional 1600 Lumens headlight up top for better night time riding. \n\nOverall, the Scooter is a great performer and happy with it!",

It's got great acceleration and you can accidentally pop your front up from standstill if you yank the accelerator. \n\nThe modes are genuinely useful, for different riding styles and levels. Here in SF, the hills slow it down to 15-18km/hr, but flats and downhills can hit 25km+. Again, it won't replace a motorcycle, but you also won't look (as much as) like a dweeb on a scooter. \n\nI think if they continue to evolve this bike & design it's going to be a long term winner. More power, range, and some tidying up of part selection and finish —the Stigo B3 will likely be excellent. They use bike components to simplify things, and I'm looking forward to when the braking etc. is more integrated for a cleaner \"pure\" e-bike look. \n\nOh, and it's pretty light so carrying it up stairs isn't the worst. The folding might be useful for car transport, but not for someone without a car. I'm assuming you can use a bike lock for it, but I haven't gotten that far yet.\n\nI think this is the right purchase for people trying to find a short-commute bike. I don't really want an actual bike, and definitely not a scooter. The more expensive versions are too expensive, and the cheaper ones can't be trusted.",

I am 6' 1\" so I am pretty tall and this thing seat me comfortably. I also like that the rear wheel is easy to fold in with a release pin. Makes it easy to carry. The battery charges lightning fast with the included charger (I think it's a speed charger). Because it has a rear shock absorber, the ride is also super smooth as the shock absorber does a great job of dealing with the LA road bumps. \n\nOverall, well worth it. I have owned a traditional standing scooter which I think is much too dangerous and also an URB-E which is a sitting scooter. The URB-E was probably my favorite one but after riding the Stigo, there is no way I can go back to riding anything else. I hope people buy and support this model because it really is a great scooter. Ewheels was super easy to deal with and their customer service and quick response to my emails was also the other reason I decided to buy it. I want something that has customer service as I don't have time to buy something that has no support. \n\nOverall, outstanding! I could not be happier!",

I love almost everything about it except for one flaw imo which is why I’m giving it four stars. The battery life is not what I expected. \nIf you ride in 3rd gear periodically going above 20 miles an hour and sometimes going over light hills, expect to only get 15 miles per charge. If you ride hard with decent hills expect to get a few miles less. Most of the time this is not an issue and for most people it probably won’t be. If you want to venture out for a day of cruising bring your charger. I have also noticed the speed decreases noticeably at around 80% charge or so. If you want more range and a little more speed go with the model right above this one. \nOverall it’s a fantastic scooter with good suspension and speed.",

          "content": "The Turbowheel dart is one of the unsung heroes of the scooter world.  Excellent acceleration, handles very well, very comfortable ride, excellent Longboard, with plenty of room for different stances.  The pneumatic tires hug the road and allow the vehicle to be tilted at steep angles and go around relatively sharp turns at moderate and high speeds.  \nTo my delight and surprise, this vehicle is excellent In wet and light to medium snow conditions.  I have not slept or less control even once or experienced any kind of hydroplaning. Way more safe than a motorcycle in those conditions.\n  The Turbowheel Dart passes my personal vehicle test which is, Going up a muddy rocky wet 15% incline in the rain on a winding road. I literally had wet mud pouring off of the long board and I didn’t have to touch foot to the ground. This vehicle looks more wimpy in the photographs online no matter where you look, in person, it looks and feels like it came off the floor of a Ford assembly plant right here in Michigan. \n The moment I opened the package I knew I had a solid vehicle like something you buy at an auto dealership.  I also appreciate the tweaks given to the turbo wheel darts at the ewheels, the handle grips are super comfortable, and the LG battery really performs well living in a temperate zone where the temperatures are 35 to 45°F for half of the year. I thought scooter season would be over for me in mid November and it’s mid December and I’m rocking on better than ever.",

          "content": "I've never done a review before, but I figured I would give it a shot considering how happy I am with the product....\n\nThis is my second scooter. I also own a Xaomi Mi M365, but wanted to upgrade to a bigger, badder scooter. I am a heavier guy (6ft 260 lbs), and the M365 did a pretty good job hauling me around. That being said, I wanted to invest in something that had a better shot at going faster and further than the M365.\n\nI did a lot of research in trying to find the best scooter in my price range ($1,000 or less), and ended up choosing the TurboWheel Dart. I looked into the Zero series, and discovered that TurboWheel puts out the same scooters, just with better parts and quality control.\n\nThe scooter arrived with spares tires and innertubes, the dolly kit, a multi-tool, and a charger. It also came with a pre-shipping checklist that eWheels performed.... Things like checking the brakes, wheel spin, verifying the charger works, etc. Only had to do the basic tightening of the handlebars, brake handles, and the handlebar extension lever. After charging the scooter to a full charge (which took about 5 hours for me) and tightening everything up, I took it out for my first ride. I was BLOWN AWAY at this thing!\n\nComing from the M365, this thing is a powerhouse. Like I said, I am 260 lbs, and this thing gets up to the advertised speed of 25 mph. I was shocked that it actually got up to the speed that is listed. Usually scooters don't make it to the top speed that's listed, especially if you are heavier than the recommended weight. This thing has no problem getting to top speed while the battery is over 50%. Under 50%, the top speed drops to about 21ish for me. I can make it up decently steep hills as well without slowing down much. I can't say what grade for certain, but for reference, my M365 would not make it up the same hills, I would have to give it a kick to assist it. Make sure you change your acceleration P-setting to \"5\" if you want to make it to the top speed below 50% battery. It will hurt your range, but you will still get the most power from the scooter even below 50% that way.\n\nThe range is great, but it's not quite what's advertised. Being heavier definitely doesn't help, so I didn't expect to get the advertised range. I usually get on average 18-20 miles before the battery gauge is on the last bar. That still says I have some battery left, but I prefer to no go lower than that to help extend the life of the batteries.\n\nThe suspension is awesome, even for someone my size. It takes the edge off of any small bumps or potholes. I didn't think it would be very effective with someone who's heavier but I was wrong. The pneumatic tires along with the suspension make this thing handle like a breeze! It feels much, much smoother than my M365.\n\nThe only real complaint I have is the headlights. The lighting on the scooter is great, you will definitely be seen while riding at night. However, the headlights do not help much for visibility for you as the rider. If you regularly ride at night in areas without ambient lighting, you will need to buy an additional bicycle light or some other forward-facing lighting solution.\n\nAnyway I will wrap this up. Bottom line is I love this scooter, it was one of the best purchases I have ever made. If you are looking for a solid scooter under the $1,000 price point, you absolutely will not go wrong with one of these!",

          "content": "I have recently acquired the Turbowheel Dart (a.k.a. Zero 9) from eWheels. It is my fifth electric scooter, and I’ve had sixteen human-powered kick scooters. I like to be standing when I ride, and I hate saddles and pedals! In this review I will not repeat the specs from the listing at eWheels or cover much of what has been reviewed by others, notably on YouTube. But I will say that the Dart is my favorite scooter ever.\n\nI was a bit worried about riding on tires that are under nine inches in diameter, because objects and debris can be big enough to stop such wheels, but I have to say that with the suspension, the ride is extremely smooth. It is a bit like flying. It is also the quietest motor I’ve had so far.\n\nFor months I was planning to buy the Turbowheel Lightening (a.k.a. Zero 10X) but I decided that I did not want to have the ability and temptation to ride at motorcycle speeds. My plan was to keep it under 20 MPH and enjoy the breeze in shorts and tees, although I do wear a full face downhill helmet. I actually prefer riding the Dart at around 15 MPH. It feels about right for the tire size and the visual road scanning. I really do not want to suit up with motorcycle gear just to go a bit faster, when it is always so hot here in Hawaii.\n\nThe scooter is low to the ground and has an extremely low center of gravity which makes it feel very stable. While the amazing suspension soaks up almost all of the road rumble, I have to remember that the tires are small and avoid taking on any surface changes that could overwhelm the front tire.\n\nThe mechanical front disc brake is small, and not as strong as I am used to, but in addition to the rear drum and also the regenerative braking, it is enough. I am particularly appreciative of the fact that the front brake is on the right. Having once learned to ride a motorcycle, that is where it should be for my brain. I can never get used to having a front brake on the left as with a bicycle. The “throttle” (really a potentiometer) has a full control curve. Most of my other scooters had basically an on or off response, so the graduated smooth and precise response from this controller is spectacular.\n\nOf course I have tested the top speed on “gear” 3 and made it to 25MPH on the flat before common sense told me to knock it off. This is probably not the scooter for frequent or regular high speed rides and extreme banking. I let the tire size and the general feel remind me that I am a fragile older man on a little scooter. Speaking of which, I found it funny that the manual recommends that people over sixty don’t ride. True, we heal slowly, but we are also sensible riders.\n\neWheels has been great. They included the trolley kit, and a bell, neither of which which I expected, and the trolley wheels work great!  They also added a pair of alternate rain tires. I am hoping to avoid tire changes as much as I can, but then they also added slime to each installed tire as a bonus. Besides being able to pull the Dart along on trolley wheels, it does of course easily fold to a very compact size, so for the first time in ages that I can easily put my scooter in the car and take it to another part of the island for a different ride. My last electric scooter would not even fit inside the car, and I have a CR-V.\n\nThe prices that eWheels charge for FedEx to Hawaii were very much lower than the competition, saving me lot of money, and then there is apparently another great reason to choose Turbowheel Dart over Zero 9, and that is genuine LG batteries on board.\n\nAt first I had a throbbing vibration from out-of-round tires, but as the miles add up on hot roads, they are rounding out and the ride is smoothing itself out to perfection\n\nCommunication from the seller, Jason at eWheels has been most impressive. If you are considering a Turbowheel Dart, look on YouTube for some really good comprehensive reviews, (also look for Zero 9), especially the one by Authen Tech.  But I can say the suspension is the best feature, and everything else seems above grade too. High quality throughout.\n\nJeffrey the Barak. August 4th 2019.",

          "content": "I spent quite some time researching a few scooters before I made my final purchase. My scooter is used for my daily 10 mile (round trip) commute to/from work (except when raining), traveling mostly on bike routes.  I have logged 149 miles on the Turbo Dart as of this review. My requirements when looking at scooters: I wanted to go up to 25 mph to keep up with the flow of traffic. I needed a scooter with suspension to handle the challenged roads here in Houston. I wanted lights to be visible to drivers. Lastly, I wanted a scooter around the 1K mark. My final two choices were the Turbowheel Dart T9, and the Mercane Wide Wheel. I ended up choosing the Dart because of the newer technology/model, availability of parts, additional suspension, and reviews of other fellow commuters.  \n\nHere is my review at 149 miles with 9 hours 23 min of riding time:\nThe Good- This scooter is comfortable. There is a fairly good amount of potholes, and uneven road surfaces in Houston. The Dart takes on the uneven road with ease. Minimal vibrations are felt in the deck or handlebars. The lights make you so visible all the way around. I ride with the lights on at all times for safety purposes. Co workers that have seen me, say it looks like I am on a futuristic hovercraft. The acceleration will put a smile on your face. You will pass bikers, and cars that are in stop and go traffic. Electric car drivers will wave and or honk at you with excitement. The build quality of this scooter makes you feel confident riding at 25 MPH. My top speed is 29 MPH going downhill.  Anything above 20 MPH and all you can really hear is wind rushing by you. Being able to keep up with traffic on bike routes is ideal for safety (keeping with the flow of cars).  85% of my route is in a 25 MPH speed zone, the other 15% being on a 35 MPH zone. Some have mentioned the folding release lever can be a bit difficult to unlock. I found it to be very secure (reassuring) and the easiest way to fold, is to apply brakes, press the handlebars forward just a little while simultaneously compressing the release lever with your foot. It will unlock, then bring handlebar to a fold. It’s also really nice the multi function travel tool that came with the scooter.\n\nOther- For some reason dogs don’t like the scooter.  The motor makes a cool electronic sound that reminds me of the car in Bee Movie (for those that like the classic cartoons, the Jetsons car). I’m not sure if there is a tone that dogs can hear that is an irritate? but it seems 70% of dogs being walked will bark at you. The battery may last the advertised 30 miles on speed 1 or 2. For me at 6’1 and 202lbs on speed 3 it needs a charge after 10 miles. The scoter gears down once the batter is around 25% feeling like the power is in between Speed 1 and 2. Granted you may have different results based on your height and weight. Another contributing factor is the temperatures in Houston currently ranging 80-98. There is no way to lock the scooter. I wish it had an app and Bluetooth connection to the Dashboard to lock, track, and upgrade software. The collapsible handle bars are a great feature, however the locking twist adjustments come loose and allow a little play almost instantly. They will not fold unless you unscrew all the way and pull out and down. I wish they would stay tight and not loosen. It takes some time to get use to the bars having a little movement.   \n\nUpgrades and Dashboard settings:\nBecause the Dart does not have an app, I downloaded and bought an app called Speed Tracker Pro by Oxagile LLC ($3.99). It’s a great app for tracking: Distance, Elapsed time, Travel time, Stopped time, Average speed, Max speed, and mapped route. My stats to date: 149.8 miles, 9hr 23m travel time, max speed 29MPH, average speed 14MPH (speed bumps, and lights account for slower avg speeds). After reading reviews of pneumatic tires going flat on different scooters, I was nervous about traveling at top speeds of 25mph and having something penetrate the tire. I bought slime to put in the tires, and I have not had a flat.  I have also purchased a set of replacement tires from Jason. The new tires definitely have a better tread pattern, and seem like they will have better traction on all surfaces.  With the Dashboard, I have set the following: P01 Backlight LED max 3 (1-3), P11 Regen braking 3 (0-5), P12 Acceleration Power 5 (1-5, default is 3), P17 Cruise Control 1 (on). Cruise Control is great, not having to hold the accelerator for long period of times.  \n\nI am very happy with my purchase, and would recommend this scooter to anyone looking for a comfortable commute scooter. Jason at Ewheels has been very helpful and responsive to any questions I’ve had. Having ridden the rideshare scooters in other cities, I can say the Turbo Dart definitely has more power, acceleration, and ride comfort then the Xiaomi Mi and Segway Ninebot rentals.",

          "content": "Already owning the turbowheel lightning, this feels like a completely different scooter. The weight difference ~40lb vs ~75lb is a HUGE benefit when maneuvering around when walking alongside it. I ride both from my apartment to the office, which involves multiple elevators and doors. The dart is very easy to walk with one hand while opening doors. Once riding the weight difference is not very noticeable. The lights are pretty neat but do seem a bit silly at times, but coming from motorcycles, more visibility is always a good thing. \n\nI think this would be a perfect scooter if it had a front motor as well, the acceleration tends to putter out above 15-20mph, unlike the lightning. The suspension also seems a bit soft seeing that I am only 155lbs, the front bottoms out often on hard bumps. The rear suspension is much more durable. \n\nThis model replaces my GoTrax GXL and mostly fits in the same use category. It folds up quite quickly, with the stem shortening and handlebars folding inwards. It also has a latch when closed that seems more reliable than the gotrax (which broke after 6 months of use).\n\nThis is definitely a sidewalk scooter, unlike the lightning which I typically use on the road most of the time. It's small enough to maneuver around crowded areas of people and move over with one hand if needed.",

          "content": "Summary:\nThe Turbowheel Dart is an attractive and very capable scooter which falls short of being the road-dominating 9-mile commuting machine I desire. For city riding, its power and speed capabilities make it more than fast enough for bike lanes but too slow for car lanes.\n\nMy background:\nI commute from Queens to Brooklyn and back every day - It's about 9 miles each way. Last year, I rode a Speedway Mini 4 for all of the warm months, totaling ~1,850 miles. I decided to replace the Mini 4 in 2019 instead of trying to keep up with all of its repairs. Since the Turbowheel Dart is EWheels' successor to the Mini 4, it seemed like the best option. I want as much power as possible, but I live in a 4th floor walk-up apartment so I'm limited by my ability to carry my scooter up 3 flights of stairs. My scooter is a central component to my lifestyle and I consider myself a particularly discerning scooter enthusiast. I weigh 172 pounds.\n\n\nWhat I like about the Turbowheel Dart:\n\nThe Dart looks really nice, and it's covered in cool LED lights which fully illuminate the ground below and around the scooter, which is an important factor for visibility and safety. When passersby see my scooter their reactions are very positive, which really does have a big impact on the riding experience.\n\nWhen fully charged, the Dart has respectable acceleration and top speed. I max out at about 23 mph on flat roads, and can out-accelerate most cyclists. \n\nThe 9-inch wheels have excellent grip and cornering ability compared to 8-inch wheels, and the front disc brake combined with a rear drum brake provides adequate braking power, which is extremely nice compared to the inferior braking on the Mini 4. \n\nThe handlebars are wide and solid, but you need to tighten their support rings when you unfold them, which takes 10-15 seconds. These rings also always come loose while riding which leads to some wiggle in the handlebars. I assume can be fixed by adding some teflon tape to their threads.\n\nThe suspension system is mechanically sound and looks very advanced, but I have a very large complaint which I'll explain in the next section.\n\n\nWhat I don't like about the Turbowheel Dart:\n\nThe suspension is way too soft for my weight (172 pounds). I'm probably heavier than average but not excessively so, and both the front and rear suspension are nowhere near strong enough to support my weight effectively. When I step on the scooter, the rear suspension completely compresses, nearly rendering it useless. The front suspension still has compression room when I'm riding on smooth ground, but even mild bumps cause it to max out and make a loud clanking noise. This suspension weakness severely limits my ability to ride on rough pavement, reduces my average speed, and makes me feel like I'm riding on a machine that was not built for my body or my level of riding. \n\nWhile the Dart has respectable power and speed at full battery, the power drops considerably as the scooter approaches half-battery and below. My Mini 4 did not fluctuate in power over the course of the battery charge nearly as much as the Dart does. For this reason, my effective top speed on the Dart is usually only 19-20 mph, but more importantly its acceleration drops as well, limiting my ability to obtain desirable road positioning relative to other vehicles. This battery is also more temperature-dependent than I'm used to. The performance in 50 degree Fahrenheit weather is noticeably worse than in 60 degrees. This is an inherent property of Li-Ion batteries, but again, the Mini 4's performance did not seem as temperature-sensitive as the Dart's. \n\nI'm afraid I'm also disappointed with the range of the Dart. I can expect 15-20 miles on a single charge, which might be enough for the average user, but it means I have to charge the scooter before my commute to work, and then again for my commute home. I used to ride my Mini 4 round-trip (18 miles) and get home with 48% battery left -- for 6 months straight. I might be able to make the full round-trip on the Dart, but the trip home would be painfully slow. \n\nPerhaps this is just a NYC thing, but I've popped three tires this month. It only takes a tiny sliver of glass to puncture these tires, and there's glass all over the place. It's also really difficult to change the rear tire and my fingers are all damaged from doing it three times. My last patch actually failed so I have to change it again tonight and I'm really not excited.\n\n\nShould you buy one?\n\nThink carefully about your use case and the class of vehicle you're looking for. Do you want a bike lane vehicle? Is your commute less than ~6 miles each way? Are you less than ~150 pounds? If you're answering yes, I recommend the Turbowheel Dart. It will outperform nearly all other consumer-level scooters on the road and it will earn you many compliments. It's certainly capable of meeting or exceeding (I assume) most people's expectations of an electric scooter.\n\nOn the contrary...\n\nIf you want to safely integrate with inner-city car traffic, if your commute is longer than 6 miles each way, if you're heavier than the average Singaporean, or if you're like me and you want to outperform cars on a vehicle you can carry up stairs, you might be equally disappointed by this scooter. I'll admit that I'm shooting for the moon and want a class of vehicle that has never before existed, but the new Dualtron Spider looks like it might be such a vehicle so I may end up upgrading to one of those. Either that or I'll get an apartment with an elevator.",

Hours and hours spent looking through forums led me here. Hesitant to drop a grand on something I've never had a chance to test I placed my faith in the community and I'm happy to say that they were right. Not only does this have the power and range I was looking for it also has a great build, solid and I have no doubts in mind that this will last me through the harsh Detroit winters. Parking is a pain, my commute from the land of free parking to my destination is just under 3 miles round trip. I know, a little overkill but you have to treat yourself. The roads here are garbage, the people driving on them are just as bad. Having the extra speed to avoid dangers more than makes up for the price. Not having to worry if i'm about to leave and forgotten to change means nothing anymore. I opted for the power charger, as advertised, 2 hours to a full charge. Shipping was fast and free. All in all I stand behind eWheels and their products. One thing I am learning to adjust to is the folding movement. My old scooter could be folded and wheeled like a wheelbarrow as the stem would lock into the frame. The Dart sadly flops around if you try to move it that way. I did read on 04/16/19 that Dart customers will be receiving a trolley kit in the near future so that should help when navigating elevators and doors.",

          "content": "eWheels' TurboWheel Dart Review\n\nTL;DR:  The Turbowheel Dart is the best value scooter if you're in the market for a rugged urban commuting solution.  You get the most scooter for your money.  While there is no perfect scooter, this is pretty darn close.  If you're on the fence, buy it; it's totally worth it.  If you want to understand why I'm emphatic about this scooter, the long read below goes in depth.\n\nLONG READ BELOW:\n\nThe Intro:\nThe promise of affordable and reliable personal electric transportation has only just been realized in the past few years.  This new market is flooded with startups and new designs and capabilities are coming to market all the time.  One of the characteristics of this new market is that there is yet to be a single dominant design, standard, or manufacturer that combines all the positive elements that each new scooter design brings with none of the drawbacks.  Electric scooters can be characterized simply along a single axis; at one end of the spectrum you can get extreme performance (speed, power, suspension, etc...), and at the other end you can get extreme portability (lightweight, dolly attachments, small size, etc...).  Unfortunately, there is no current scooter on the market that can provide both extreme performance and extreme portability, either one must be sacrificed for the other.  So the consumer is left with the decision of what tradeoffs they are willing to make to get the most out of their scooter.  Their decision about how much of each thing they are willing to trade off is informed by their use-case; how they use the machine.  Be aware that my glowing opinion of this scooter is based on how well it meets my particular use-case, so the old cliché holds true, \"Your mileage may vary.\"  However, I think that my use-case, which I will describe before giving my review, is fairly common among city dwellers, particularly on the east coast.  You be the judge.\n\nMy Use-Case:\nI live in Washington DC, but I'm from New York and it shows in this paragraph.  The roads are more pothole than road, and more loose gravel than smooth asphalt.  In winter they salt the roads like idiot lunatics if they even hear about the chance of snow.  Half the time the salt sits there with no snow or rain and it creates a dust that coats the roads, and sidewalks, and cars.  Otherwise, it rains lightly and mixes with the salt to form a corrosive slurry that destroys exposed electronics and bare metals.  It's really humid most months, and the temperature variance between summer and winter is triple digit to single digit (Fahrenheit, of course).  Also, the traffic is among the worst in the country, 50% because the city's roads were designed by an imbecile french-american in the late 1700s (Google it) and added onto by more modern idiots as time went by.  The other 50% of traffic is because halfwits and goobers from three states: VA, MD, and DC (I know, not a state), drive in it every day, and they have no @&*#-ing clue what they are doing.  Seriously.  And I commute 3.2 miles each way to and from work in this shitshow every day of the year, barring serious snow, in which case I take the metro, or what normal people call the subway.  Let's not talk about how bad DC's subway system is.  Anyway, I'm 6' 3\" tall and I weigh 215 lbs.  This is really important if you're trying to figure out how the stated specs of this scooter might scale with your particular body size.  Point is, I'm not as big as some, but I'm bigger than most, and frankly I'm pretty weak for my size as my lanky arms and FUPA can attest to.  Most of my commute I have a dedicated bike lane that drivers often ignore, and parked cars routinely open their doors into obliviously.  Also, I value speed and efficiency over safety because @#&! you and your helmet laws, I didn't wear one growing up and I'm not about to start now.  I like to live dangerously.  When I'm not on my scooter I have to carry it around either going up the stairs to my apartment or squeezing through the turnstiles at the gates of my office campus.  I have to keep it hidden under my desk, because the safety nerds are scared of big lithium batteries (I get it, but the risk is seriously overblown, pun intended).  The bottom line is I'm a big guy who likes to go fast down narrow streets with lots of potholes, loose gravel, corrosive salt spray, and I need to swerve around idiots who don't see me or don't care, and be able to brake really quickly in case my swerving isn't enough to save my dumb ass.  Then I have to be able to deftly man-handle the scooter without messing up my lower back.  I don't want to pay more than $1200.00 for a scooter; I just don't have the money for that.  Lastly, I want the maintenance to be as easy and minimal as possible.  I want to ride my scooter, not clean it, grease it, degrease it, adjust it, de-rust it, fix it, etc...\n\nThe Review Proper:\nThe above use-case is a tall order for most scooters in today's market.  The Turbowheel Dart is the best yet at satisfying all these requirements.  Is it perfect?  No, but it's darn close.  The critical element that this scooter gets right is balance.  I mean the balance between extreme performance and extreme portability.  Is it the most portable?  No.  Is it the best performer?  No.  But the balance of those two elements combined with the cost is spot on for how I want to use a scooter.\n\nInstead of describing each sub-system of the scooter by itself, like suspension, motor, brakes, etc., I'm gonna try what I think is a more intuitive approach.  I'm going to describe how it is able to overcome each unique obstacle/requirement presented by my use-case.  Often times a single use-case requirement is satisfied by multiple scooter sub-systems working together.  I think this is a more useful way of looking at it, because if all you want to know is specs and features you can just go to the eWheels website.  They do a great job of listing all the relevant specs and features for their products, including this scooter.\n\nSide note, check out this YouTube video: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQyEEeieqM).  It tells you how to change a bunch of useful settings on your scooter including acceleration and electric braking force.  You can find some of this information on the eWheels website but there are settings described in this video that you can't find on the eWheels website or the user manual.  I'll refer to it throughout the review as the YouTube video from now on.  Let's begin!\n\n1) Going Fast:  One of my use-case criterions is I like to go fast.  With my weight (215 lbs) I can go 22 mph on flat ground, and 15 mph on hills with a 15-20 degree grade.  Downhill I can do 28 mph.  Granted these speeds do not come close to what the higher end scooters or electric unicycles can achieve, but for some perspective this is fast enough that the wind noise in your ears makes it hard to hear things around you, and without goggles your eyes will water from all the wind.  Now if you weigh less than me, those numbers will go up.  Good for you!  From a dead stop I can get to 15 mph in about 3 seconds.  From 15mph to 22 mph takes an additional 3 seconds.  I broke it up like that because often times there's not enough room to get a full 6 seconds of uninterrupted acceleration before I have to slow down for a car or pedestrian.  So often times I'm cruising around 15 mph and then I burst up to 22 mph, then come down to zero.  The YouTube video shows how the acceleration can be adjusted on a scale of 1-5, 5 being the fastest acceleration.  The numbers I'm citing above are with the acceleration set to 5.\n\n2) Braking Fast:  I like speed, but I also like living.  Power is useless without control.  If I'm doing 22 mph on the road, I need to be able to stop quickly in case someone opens their door into the bike lane or a kid darts out into traffic.  On level ground I tested emergency braking (stopping as quickly as possible) from a max speed of 22 mph.  I went from 22 mph to 0 mph in 30 ft.  That is very good when you consider my above average weight (compared to the average user) and the scooter's above average speed (when compared to other scooters of the same weight).  The combination of front disk brake, rear drum brake, and electronic braking is what allows the scooter to stop with authority.\n\nA note about the electronic braking; I learned from the YouTube video that you can adjust the intensity of the electronic braking under the settings menu of the dash board.  It ranges from 1-5, and there is no reason not to max it out at level 5, just don't charge the battery to 100%.  This way the battery can soak the additional current generated without overheating when the electronic braking is engaged.  If the battery is at 100% and you feed additional current to it when you apply electronic braking you'll overcharge the cells and risk damaging the battery thus reducing its useful lifespan or worse (potential fire hazard).  I did skid to a stop during my brake test, which is not ideal because a locked rear wheel that enters a skid actually takes a longer distance to reach a full stop.  An Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) would fix that and there are some scooters that come with ABS standard, but that improved performance comes at a cost.  The scooters that offer ABS standard weigh in from 44 lbs to 95 lbs (dualtron spider - dualtron thunder) and cost between $2450.00 and $3850.00.  Both the weight and the cost exceed the requirements of my use-case, the weight by only a little when considering the spider, but the cost by quite a lot.\n\nOne upgrade that would be worthwhile is changing the mechanical cable brake lines that come with this model to hydraulic brake lines.  Hydraulic brakes multiply the braking force the calipers can exert and they do so without fatiguing the user's grip on the brake levers.  The cable brakes are fine, but aggressive braking habits like mine stretch the cable quickly and require more frequent maintenance to ensure that the brake lever action remains tight.  Not ideal from a maintenance standpoint but the brake lines are very easy to adjust on this model.\n\n3) Smooth Nimble Ride Over Rough Urban Terrain:  The front and rear shocks combined with the 8.5 inch diameter air tires means that I can handle asphalt, loose gravel, small bumps, cracks, divots, dips, and the occasional trolley car tracks without worrying or losing control.  I only have to swerve or slow down to avoid potholes and anything with a lip (like a steel construction plate) that is greater than 1 inch thick.\n\nI can also lean into turns at speed thanks to those air tires gripping the road.  This thing even handles all dirt/gravel roads and short grass.  It's a little dicey on short grass but if you're just cutting a straight line (no sharp turns) across a city park, it's no problem.  Also, the shocks are so bouncy that with a little practice you can easily take on speed bumps and other unpleasant small bumps or cracks without slowing down.  Technically, you don't need to do anything special to handle a speed bump made for a car with your scooter, but if you want to save your front shocks a little you can pop a small wheelie so that your front tire hits the flat of the speed bump instead of the base of the bump, thus reducing the shock felt by the front spring.  This wheelie maneuver is a lot easier to perform thanks to the super bouncy suspension and very torque-y motor.\n\nThe deck plate is wide and long enough that I can ride in a variety of stances from one foot in front of the other (I'm a size 11.5) to both feet side by side (lesser known but equally important my shoe width size is E) and anything in between.  All in all it is a very comfortable ride, and the vibration is so little that my feet do not get tired or sore from riding.\n\n4) Riding Time (Charge Duration):  I've run this scooter down from 100% full to one battery tick mark left (approx. 20% or less capacity) and I can get about 12 miles on a charge going full speed all the time.  It does start to get a little sluggish when it gets down to two battery tick marks remaining, but it's not a problem for my commute.  One little idiosyncrasy of the battery display is that it displays the real time amperage draw of the battery, not its total capacity.  What that means is that when the scooter starts at 100% and you start accelerating from a dead stop the battery display goes from full tick marks down to two tick marks.  This means it's drawing a lot of current from the battery, which is totally normal, it's just not an accurate representation of the actual total capacity of the battery.  To get that information you just need to come to a stop, wait five seconds and whatever the battery indicator level is at is the actual total remaining capacity.  Not very intuitive from a user experience standpoint but easy to code into the microprocessor.\n\n5) Low Maintenance and Easy Maintenance:  As long as you don't ride this scooter in heavy rain or large puddles (unless you mod it like I did, see more below), the only maintenance you need to do is adjusting the brake cable tension as you feel it getting looser.  Both front and rear brakes can be easily adjusted both at the handlebars (not recommended for major adjustments) and where the brake line meets the caliper (recommended for most, if not all adjustments).  The hardware is solid and can withstand multiple adjustments over the life of the scooter.  The screws that secure the brake line to the calipers are heavy duty.  The front brake uses a M6 screw with a M5 driver (beefy), and the rear brake uses a Philips head screw (either #3 or #4) that is definitely beefier than a #2 Philips head.  Granted the Philips head screw can be more prone to stripping, but so long as you use the right size driver you won't have any problems tightening and loosening that screw.\n\nOther than the brakes, you can choose to occasionally wipe down the road grime that will build up on the deck and other parts that are near or contact the road.  If you do decide to run this thing in all weather conditions, you'll want to go the extra mile and seal it up good and tight.  As an addendum to this review I created a YouTube video (not the one I've been referencing in the paragraphs above), here's the link: (https://youtu.be/0HWms51U2x8)  I'll summarize the contents of the video in the next section below as the mods I made have a lot to do with improving the durability, specifically the weather resistance of the scooter.\n\n6) Durability (Construction Quality and Weather Resistance):  Don't let the fact that I modded this scooter lead you to think this is not a well-built machine.  It is very well built when you consider that it was never intended for all weather use and manufactured (like all commercially sold goods in this world) with profit in mind.  This is a well-made scooter.  I am OCD and have a background in mechanical engineering and a general love of taking apart the things I own to either break them permanently or, hopefully, make them better.  In this case I got lucky and made this great scooter even better.  I'm going to cheat a bit and refer you to my video for this section because it does a much better job of describing this aspect of the scooter than I can with just words alone.  If I were to write up my thoughts on the build quality of the scooter this paragraph would be longer than the entire review thus far, and you're already a damn hero for reading this much, I don't want to push it.  Be warned, the video is very thorough and long (who would've guessed, right?), but it details mods that I think most anybody can do as well as some mods that require a more...adventurous tinkerer.  I think they will really help to extend the life of the scooter and make it useable in a much wider variety of climates, particularly wet, possibly salty climates like Washington, DC.  Again the URL for the video is https://youtu.be/0HWms51U2x8\n\n7) Easy Portability:  This is the one area where I sacrificed some of my trade space so I could gain value in the other areas described above.  At 39.5 lbs this scooter is by no means light.  With no dolly attachment that comes standard it can be a pain to haul around when you have to climb stairs or go through turnstiles.  I've been able to take it with me to work and overcome all the physical obstacles without much issue; I just have to be careful to grip the stem in the right spot where the center of gravity is so that it rests evenly in my hand.  In the folded configuration the locked folding joint is very stiff, which makes carrying it a lot easier.  If the scooter were somehow magically 10-20 pounds lighter without sacrificing performance, this would be the greatest scooter on the planet hands down.\n\nThe folding handlebars are top notch, and when tightened properly offer no play during riding.  The quick lock for the telescoping stem is also solid, and when adjusted to the proper tension holds the stem in place very tightly.  It's also nice because there are no preset detents in the stem and so you have infinite adjustability of handlebar height within the top and bottom limits of the stem extension tube.  The stem extension tube is smooth and featureless.  It would have been nice if they embossed some gradations along its length so that you could quickly return the unfolded scooter to your preset handlebar height without guessing where that is each time you unfold it.  That is easily overcome by either painting or scratching a mark onto the stem extension tube to mark your preset handlebar height.\n\nA slight gripe is the red latch pedal that locks and unlocks the folding mechanism.  It's a little short to be easily stepped on by my foot, and it's even harder to access it when trying to unfold the scooter.  It requires a little finesse to get the proper pressure on the foot pedal and you have to jiggle the stem slightly to get it to unfold.  Folding requires that you put forward pressure on the handlebars while depressing the pedal before it fully unseats the locking pin at which point you can tilt the stem and handlebars into the folded position.  This precise and slightly finicky folding action is the result of an intentional adjustment I made to the locking pin set screws.  I adjusted these screws so that the locking pin would seat itself tightly in the locked position.  I did this to minimize the play in the locked joint as much as possible while riding; I hate slop in the folding mechanism while riding.  That slop can also be dangerous because if you're too aggressive you could unseat the pin while riding or damage the base of the stem.  So a tight mechanism comes at the cost of slightly finicky folding and unfolding.  A few practice rounds of folding and unfolding the scooter and the motions become very easy.\n\n8) Cost:  There is no other scooter that offers this much bang for the buck when comparing its feature set with others in this price and weight range.  It also met my criteria for being below $1200.00, and it has a full one year warranty with the eWheels company, which is better than most scooter manufacturers offer.  The warranty even covers the battery, which is really great!\n\nFinal Thoughts for Masochists Who like Reading:  I have never written a review in my life, I'm sure it could be better.  I bothered attempting this because I believe in this product and equally importantly I believe in one of the owners of the eWheels company, Jason (don't know his last name).  Just to be clear, we are not associates or friends, and I get no kickbacks of any kind for endorsing his business or this product.  So, how can you believe in a guy and you don't even know his last name?  Good question, the answer is easy, he has consistently provided the best customer service of any scooter manufacturer/vendor that I have ever contacted, and in my efforts to find the right machine for me, I have contacted many of them.  Every single time I have called (and I have called him a lot) he has answered, without fail, and provided patient and enthusiastic advice.  He appreciates his customers, is very knowledgeable about his stock, and makes a real effort to improve the quality of the products he sells.  So if you're debating between buying this model and something comparable offered elsewhere, you would do well to add another consideration to your equation, customer service.  It's something that can be hard to quantify, but it is worth a lot.  His service is the best I've seen in this industry and if for no other reason, that alone should tip the scales of your decision in his favor when considering your purchase.  Thanks for taking the time to read this, I really hope it helped.",

          "content": "At the time of this review I've had the scooter for 43 days and have ridden 210 miles on it. The build quality is excellent, with a fantastic ride due to the suspension and the air-filled tires. Acceleration is quick, and the top speed is very fast (I've gotten up to 21mph on the highest speed mode). eWheels support has been fantastic with immediately addressing any questions/issues I have had--this is a big selling point as my previous scooter (not a TurboWheel Dart) was from an overseas vendor who continues to be unresponsive 3-months later to part failures covered under their supposed 'warranty'. The only major downside to this scooter is its weight (~40lb) which can make it challenging to lug around for extensive periods of time--however this downside is easily offset by the quality of the scooter. Despite having a nice screw-cap mechanism for the handle bars they routinely become loose over time, however the manufacturer has mentioned in the comments of their youtube video to \"wrap some white Plumbers tape on the screw part of the handlebar and you should be fine﻿\" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-di_FadvRwQ). A nice unadvertised feature is that this scooter has a cruise control feature that is omitted from the manual, but discussed by the manufacturer in a youtube clip (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQyEEeieqM). While the video is discussing a slightly different model, the cruise control feature (setting 'P17') is identical. If you're looking for a serious commuting scooter, I would recommend the TurboWheel Dart with no reservations.",

          "content": "This is a long-term review of the Hornet after having ridden this model for about 3 months and putting about 150 miles on it. I'm currently riding the second one from e-wheels after the first one came delivered with a dead front motor that was incapable of operation, leading to its return to Jason. To his credit, he sent a prepaid RMA and Fedex'd out a replacement Hornet to me within days which exemplified his stellar customer service. Jason's enthusiasm in helping customers with after-sales service should be high on the criteria list for any potential customer of e-scooters, since almost all of us will have minor (and maybe not-so-minor) issues that occur. \n\nHere’s a partial list of positives and negatives:\n+ Power. Hornet’s dual motor will get you up almost any 11-12% grade for a 200lb rider. It can be ridden with both motors working or with just one motor on flats to save on battery and increased range. \n+ The fast fold and unfolding puts it in a league by itself and makes it an awesome commuter tool. Complete handlebar flat-fold and steering column into locked-position collapse takes 4 seconds. Complete reassembly to riding portion takes less than 10 seconds including turning on the ignition. 57 lbs is luggable by most guys up two flights of stairs so this can complete the last mile commuting solution.\n+ Built-in horn with front and rear LED lights help with jaywalkers and stop-sign runners in traffic. Working rear brake light is another bonus.\n+ Dual hydraulic disc brakes are a big win. You’ll thank your lucky stars you have more than a single foot-actuated rear brake on your first close encounter. ABS I can imagine would be even better but the dual disc braking system are a good close second. Make good braking part of the purchasing choice - a consideration worth noting as scooters like the Mercane have had recalls over their braking systems and the Wide Wheel had only one rear brake to start with.\n\n- The suspension on the front and back are almost decorative and will not provide much plushiness if that’s an important criteria for you. I’m about 200lbs and don’t feel much dampening even with a bit of preload tinkering. Combine this with the solid wheels and the ride can be jarring. Big potholes are to be feared. \n- Some spot welds are not great and a few screws need to be tightened/loosened to more appropriate amounts of torque.\n- The rubber grips it comes with are trashy and need to be replaced as a safety precaution. Same with the plasticky trolley wheels. Replacement with spitfire tablets made a huge difference.\n- Tiny diameter wheels lead to the lack of gyroscopic effect, and the Hornet's 8-inch wheels are smaller than most. Not faulting the Hornet regarding physics but people coming off motorcycles and bicycles will be in for a surprise to feel the instability, especially at higher turning speeds. Anyone who claims it’s thrilling to take an e-scooter to 50 mph through the twisties has a death wish. \n\nFor a gadget meant for consumer enjoyment, the Hornet is engineered well and it’s a bucket-load of fun. When schlepped through the transit station, the built-in trolley makes it super-convenient and a feature most will instantly appreciate. While it doesn't provide the best ride for the wide-open suburbs, in my use as a commuting solution paired with public transit, I give the Hornet an overall I rating of 4.5 star but the service component notches it up to the full 5 stars. I promised Jason that I'd leave positive feedback on my purchasing experience and hope this review compensates for his wonderful help.",

          "content": "Weight: Heavier than DT Spider and TW Dart which makes it feel more stable. By that I mean the feeling of having to suddenly stop while going at top speed. \nSuspension: Not as smooth as TW Dart and light years away from DT Spider. \nPortability: A- compared to it's little brother however built in trolley makes up for it.\nLights: Front light feels aftermarket but serves it purpose, however the horn it's built into the posterior aspect of the front light and is loud enough. No ambient lights, what!? Just get strip led lights w/ battery box from Amazon if you want to increase night visibility.\nAcceleration: Feels sligthly slower than it's little brother but range is twice as much. \nBrakes: A+++, worked really well. We had a car ran a STOP sign, scoother stopped well and both tires remained on the ground without loosing control. My wife was on DT Spider, she was able to stop but back tire and frame went forward and sideways. That is what I mean when it comes to scooter weight and comfort level while riding at high speed.\nFender: Metal and powder coated, nice finish!. \nCharger: Stock charger is slowwww, get the fast charger from ewheels website.\nOverall: Very happy with purchase, this is my go to scooter from a lineup of TW Dart and DT Spider.",

I’ve even jumped it and takes it pretty well just have to do your check ups and make sure it’s tight 10/10 from me BUT!! Be careful if the battery is low and you are on full throttle going fast it will give you a DRAMATIC warning so just make sure it’s charged or you’re not going 30-35 and crash that is my only complaint but geez it’s addicting and thought I’d need such a fast one that’s got everything I need but this has way more as soon as you’re going over 30 is when you have enough... my shipment did take a while though but it was well worth it",

Being my first high power beast scooter and after seeing all the \"normal\" ones lol on the street, this scooter is huge and hungry! Pictures and videos don't do it justice till you see it in person. Yes it's a heavy beast. Everything is just big and built well and tough. The fit and finish is quality stuff. I might mention that if your motor axle looks to be longer on one side than the other, don't worry as it's like this from the factory.\n  \nIt's tempting to jump on it and head out as soon as you can but I suggest going over the scooter and checking all the bolts, screws etc. Be careful with the 2 set screws at bottom of stem where it bends as mine was super tight and I stripped it. When you do ride for the first time, just be super careful when going over 30 mph cause the front wheel's gonna wobble. Grip the handlebars well and wear safety gear for sure. Actually just use mode 1 till you get the hang of it.\n\nAcceleration is neck snapping so hold on. No cell phone in one hand and handle bar on the other. It'll buck you off lol. It'll even wheel spin while in motion.  You'll be able to blast past cars and even pass them. I basically just ride on the roads now with all the other cars. Oh, wear safety gear for sure. Brakes are strong and well modulated. The \"Eco/Turbo\" and \"Single/Dual\" buttons can be confusing so I picture it as 2 rows and going across left to right would be in/out for Eco/Single and out/in for Turbo/Dual.\n\n You'll be sore, especially your legs after you ridden it first time. Don't lean or pull on the handlebars too much. Just  lean forward when accelerating and lean back when braking. Turn by looking in the direction and lean with your body. Hills are a piece of cake for this monster. As for mileage, well it depends. I have the 60v battery so If you have steep hills and ride with no worries and use turbo and have fun, then you're looking at around 20 miles. Ifyou go easy and use eco or single or lower speed modes, then it'll be close to the advertised specs.\n\nLast but not least, the crew at eWheels are super great and super helpfull. They respond quickly to questions and are very knowledgeable. Thanks eWheels for putting up with my 20+ emails and countless changes to my order. Plus I got some surprises with my order too. So if you want to know how it feels like to ride on a magic carpet, well I suggest you get a hold of eWheels asap!",

          "content": "My first electric scooter was the Turbowheel Swift. After putting about 200 miles on the swift I decided that I really enjoyed the scooter and I was ready for an upgrade. Now I am reviewing the Turbowheel Lightning+ after putting 576 miles on it. This scooter still operates flawlessly, no flat tires, no electrical problems just runs really well and strong. I kind of wish I could get some kind of commission by all the referrals I sent to Jason at Ewheels because I am constantly being stopped and ask so many questions and where do I get one. The only problem I have had is I burned out a charger by hooking up the wrong one to the lightning plus, I called Jason and told him what happened and he sent me another charger in two days free of charge and I thought that was very nice of him. I explain to him it was my fault the reason it burned out and he said don’t worry about it just think of me next time you’re in the market for another scooter. I guarantee you if I purchase another scooter I probably will be knocking on Jason’s door once again. I weigh 190 pounds and so far my top speed was 40 miles an hour. By the way the swift now has 350 miles on it and still performs flawlessly as well. I give the swift to my wife but my neighbors love and enjoy riding it almost as much as me. I live in South Carolina and don’t see a whole lot of adult electric scooters but there sure is no lack of interest. Thank you Jason for awesome business practices and by the way the Turbowheel Phaeton sure looks awesome!",

I initially looked at razor and others like them but quickly realized how much of a disadvantages those scooters are by comparison.  I weigh 170-180lbs and live in a very hill area with plenty of trails.  This scooter eats it up and keeps wanting to go faster.  I've only gotten it up to 30 mph but normally I can comfortably cruise at 25 mph.  It feels solid and smooth even though I still get surprised by the torque pull.  I have the offroad wheels and have a great time on dirt and rock/gravel covered trails.  The suspension is great for the trails.  I'm seriously contemplating buying a second.  I kind of wish I could commute to work with this. :D",

Jason, Marc & the entire ewheels team were very helpful in helping me navigate all options even as I continued to bombard them with numerous questions. If you're looking for an excellent scooter and the perfect team behind your back, then the Lighting+ is the one to get and Ewheels is the place to get it from.

The delivery was quick. The customer service has been AWESOME!  The scooter has three gears and options to use both motors and turbo or no turbo giving you exactly the ride you want!  I have had my scooter up to 39mph and love the ride!  This scooter is amazing. I have been telling my friends to get this scooter if they were thinking about buying one. Great purchase!",
