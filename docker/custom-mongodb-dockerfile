# This 3rd-party (official, though) Docker image doesn't have `curl` available out of the box 
# nor it's possible to install it from a bash script (not enough permissions). 
# A new image is built here, which is going to have `curl` installed, 
# which is used to send HTTP request to trigger database population.
#
# For more details, have a look at:
# - `trigger-population.sh`
# - `npm run populate-db`
